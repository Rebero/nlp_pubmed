0,Pristimerin attenuates cell proliferation of uveal melanoma cells by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and its downstream pathways,"Uveal melanoma (UM) has a high mortality rate due to liver metastasis. The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is highly expressed in UM and has been shown to be associated with hepatic metastases. Targeting IGF signalling may be considered as a promising approach to inhibit the process of metastatic UM cells. Pristimerin (PRI) has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of several cancer cells, but its role and underlying mechanisms in the IGF-1-induced UM cell proliferation are largely unknown. The present study examined the anti-proliferative effect of PRI on UM cells and its possible role in IGF-1R signalling transduction. MTT and clonogenic assays were used to determine the role of PRI in the proliferation of UM cells. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the effect of PRI on the cell cycle distribution of UM cells. Western blotting was carried out to assess the effects of PRI and IGF-1 on the IGF-1R phosphorylation and its downstream targets. The results indicated that IGF-1 promoted the UM cell proliferation and improved the level of IGF-1R phosphorylation, whereas PRI attenuated the effect of IGF-1. Interestingly, PRI could not only induce the G1 phase accumulation and reduce the G2 phase induced by IGF-1, but also could stimulate the expression of p21 and inhibit the expression of cyclin D1. Besides, PRI could attenuate the phosphorylations of Akt, mTOR and ERK1/2 induced by IGF-1. Furthermore, the molecular docking study also demonstrated that PRI had potential inhibitory effects on IGF-1R. Taken together, these results indicated that PRI could inhibit the proliferation of UM cells through down-regulation of phosphorylated IGF-1R and its downstream signalling.","Pristimerin attenuates cell proliferation of uveal melanoma cells by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and its downstream pathways.

0,Differential molecular modeling predictions of mid and conventional dialysate flows,"Background: High dialysate flow rates (QD) of 500-800 mL/ min are used to maximize urea removal during conventional hemodialysis. There are few data describing hemodialysis with use of mid-rate QD (300 mL/min). Methods: We constructed uremic solute (urea, beta2-microglobulin and phosphate) kinetic models at varying volumes of distribution and blood flow rates to predict solute clearances at QD of 300 and 500 mL/min. Results: Across a range of volumes of distribution a QD of 300 mL/min generally yields a predicted urea spKt/V greater than 1.2 during typical treatment times with a small difference in urea spKt/V between a QD of 300 and 500 mL/min. A larger urea KoA dialyzer and 15 min of additional time narrows the urea spKt/V difference. No substantial differences were observed regarding the kinetics of beta2-microglobulin and phosphate for QD of 300 vs. 500 mL/ min. Conclusion: A QD of 300 mL/min can achieve urea clearance targets. Hemodialysis systems using mid-rate QD can be expected to provide adequate hemodialysis, as currently defined.","Differential molecular modeling predictions of mid and conventional dialysate flows.

0,Development of a Mouse Pain Scale Using Sub-second Behavioral Mapping and Statistical Modeling,"Rodents are the main model systems for pain research, but determining their pain state is challenging. To develop an objective method to assess pain sensation in mice, we adopt high-speed videography to capture sub-second behavioral features following hind paw stimulation with both noxious and innocuous stimuli and identify several differentiating parameters indicating the affective and reflexive aspects of nociception. Using statistical modeling and machine learning, we integrate these parameters into a single index and create a â€œmouse pain scale,â€ which allows us to assess pain sensation in a graded manner for each withdrawal. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining sensations triggered by three different von Frey hairs and optogenetic activation of two different nociceptor populations. Our behavior-based â€œpain scaleâ€ approach will help improve the rigor and reproducibility of using withdrawal reflex assays to assess pain sensation in mice. Abdus-Saboor et al. develop a behavior-centered â€œmouse pain scaleâ€ using high-speed videography, statistical modeling, and machine learning. With this method, they assess the sensation induced by noxious, innocuous, and optogenetic stimuli. This method will improve the reliability of using the mouse hind paw withdrawal to measure pain.","Development of a Mouse Pain Scale Using Sub-second Behavioral Mapping and Statistical Modeling.

0,Characterization of disease-specific cellular abundance profiles of chronic inflammatory skin conditions from deconvolution of biopsy samples,"Background: Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are two inflammatory skin diseases with a high prevalence and a significant burden on the patients. Underlying molecular mechanisms include chronic inflammation and abnormal proliferation. However, the cell types contributing to these molecular mechanisms are much less understood. Recently, deconvolution methodologies have allowed the digital quantification of cell types in bulk tissue based on mRNA expression data from biopsies. Using these methods to study the cellular composition of the skin enables the rapid enumeration of multiple cell types, providing insight into the numerical changes of cell types associated with chronic inflammatory skin conditions. Here, we use deconvolution to enumerate the cellular composition of the skin and estimate changes related to onset, progress, and treatment of these skin diseases. Methods: A novel signature matrix, i.e. DerM22, containing expression data from 22 reference cell types, is used, in combination with the CIBERSORT algorithm, to identify and quantify the cellular subsets within whole skin biopsy samples. We apply the approach to public microarray mRNA expression data from the skin layers and 648 samples from healthy subjects and patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The methodology is validated by comparison to experimental results from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry studies, and the deconvolution of independent data from isolated cell types. Results: We derived the relative abundance of cell types from healthy, lesional, and non-lesional skin and observed a marked increase in the abundance of keratinocytes and leukocytes in the lesions of both inflammatory dermatological conditions. The relative fraction of these cells varied from healthy to diseased skin and from non-lesional to lesional skin. We show that changes in the relative abundance of skin-related cell types can be used to distinguish between mild and severe cases of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and trace the effect of treatment. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates the value of this new resource in interpreting skin-derived transcriptomics data by enabling the direct quantification of cell types in a skin sample and the characterization of pathological changes in tissue composition.","Characterization of disease-specific cellular abundance profiles of chronic inflammatory skin conditions from deconvolution of biopsy samples.

0,Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms Are Associated With Lower Adaptive Behavior Skills in Children With Autism,"Objective: To investigate the predictive power of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms on adaptive behavior skills in children who have an autism specrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Method: This case-control study recruited 347 children from specialty clinics, primary care, and the community. Linear regression was used to test whether ADHD Rating Scale, Fourth Edition, scores of autistic children associated with poorer adaptive behavior scores, after controlling for the effects of age, intelligence, sex, and ASD symptom severity. Adaptive behaviors were measured with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition. Subsequent analyses tested this relation in a subset of the ASD sample with subclinical ADHD symptoms (n = 179) and another with teacher ratings (n = 153). Prior relations between age with adaptive behaviors and ADHD symptoms were replicated and age was explored as a moderator. Results: ADHD symptoms predicted poor adaptive behavior scores in the full ASD sample (caregiver ratings, Î”R2 = 0.033â€“0.119; teacher ratings, Î”R2 = 0.113â€“0.163) and in the subset with subclinical ADHD symptoms (caregiver ratings, Î”R2= 0.023â€“0.030; teacher ratings, Î”R2 = 0.097â€“0.159) after controlling for confounds. Age correlated negatively with ADHD symptoms (r = âˆ’0.21) and adaptive behaviors (âˆ’0.17 < r < âˆ’0.39) in the full ASD sample. Age did not moderate the effect of ADHD symptoms on adaptive behaviors. Conclusion: ADHD symptoms predict poorer adaptive behavior for autistic children across settings, even for children with subclinical co-occurring ADHD symptoms. Findings support a Research Domain Criteria framework that behavioral impairments and functional outcome measures exist along a continuum.","Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms Are Associated With Lower Adaptive Behavior Skills in Children With Autism.

0,Computational identification of deleterious synonymous variants in human genomes using a feature-based approach,"Background: Although synonymous single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) do not alter the protein sequences, they have been shown to play an important role in human disease. Distinguishing pathogenic sSNVs from neutral ones is challenging because pathogenic sSNVs tend to have low prevalence. Although many methods have been developed for predicting the functional impact of single nucleotide variants, only a few have been specifically designed for identifying pathogenic sSNVs. Results: In this work, we describe a computational model, IDSV (Identification of Deleterious Synonymous Variants), which uses random forest (RF) to detect deleterious sSNVs in human genomes. We systematically investigate a total of 74 multifaceted features across seven categories: splicing, conservation, codon usage, sequence, pre-mRNA folding energy, translation efficiency, and function regions annotation features. Then, to remove redundant and irrelevant features and improve the prediction performance, feature selection is employed using the sequential backward selection method. Based on the optimized 10 features, a RF classifier is developed to identify deleterious sSNVs. The results on benchmark datasets show that IDSV outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in identifying sSNVs that are pathogenic. Conclusions: We have developed an efficient feature-based prediction approach (IDSV) for deleterious sSNVs by using a wide variety of features. Among all the features, a compact and useful feature subset that has an important implication for identifying deleterious sSNVs is identified. Our results indicate that besides splicing and conservation features, a new translation efficiency feature is also an informative feature for identifying deleterious sSNVs. While the function regions annotation and sequence features are weakly informative, they may have the ability to discriminate deleterious sSNVs from benign ones when combined with other features. The data and source code are available on website http://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn:8080/IDSV.","Computational identification of deleterious synonymous variants in human genomes using a feature-based approach.

0,The triple variable index combines information generated over time from common monitoring variables to identify patients expressing distinct patterns of intraoperative physiology,"BACKGROUND: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), bispectral index (BIS), and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) represent valuable, yet dynamic intraoperative monitoring variables. They provide information related to poor outcomes when considered together, however their collective behavior across time has not been characterized. METHODS: We have developed the Triple Variable Index (TVI), a composite variable representing the sum of z-scores from MAP, BIS, and MAC values that occur together during surgery. We generated a TVI expression profile, defined as the sequential TVI values expressed across time, for each surgery where concurrent MAP, BIS, and MAC monitoring occurred in an adult patient (â‰¥18â€‰years) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between January and July 2014 (nÂ =â€‰5296). Patterns of TVI expression were identified using k-means clustering and compared across numerous patient, procedure, and outcome characteristics. TVI and the triple low state were compared as prediction models for 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The median frequency MAP, BIS, and MAC were recorded was one measurement every 3, 5, and 5â€‰min. Three expression patterns were identified: elevated, mixed, and depressed. The elevated pattern displayed the highest average MAP, BIS, and MAC values (86.5â€‰mmHg, 45.3, and 0.98, respectively), while the depressed pattern displayed the lowest values (76.6â€‰mmHg, 38.0, 0.66). Patterns (elevated, mixed, depressed) were distinct across the following characteristics: average patient age (52, 53, 54â€‰years), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 4 (6.7, 16.1, 27.3%) and 5 (0.1, 0.6, 1.6%) categories, cardiac (2.2, 6.5, 16.1%) and emergent (5.8, 10.5, 12.8%) surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass use (0.3, 2.6, 9.8%), intraoperative medication administration including etomidate (3.0, 7.3, 12.6%), hydromorphone (47.6, 26.3, 25.2%), ketamine (11.2, 4.6, 3.0%), dexmedetomidine (18.4, 16.6, 13.6%), phenylephrine (74.0, 74.8, 83.0), epinephrine (2.0, 6.0, 18.0%), norepinephrine (2.4, 7.5, 21.2%), vasopressin (3.4, 7.6, 21.0%), succinylcholine (74.0, 69.0, 61.9%), intraoperative hypotension (28.8, 33.0, 52.3%) and the triple low state (9.4, 30.3, 80.0%) exposure, and 30-day postoperative mortality (0.8, 2.7, 5.6%). TVI was a better predictor of patients that died or survived in the 30â€‰days following surgery compared to cumulative triple low state exposure (AUC 0.68 versus 0.62, pÂ <â€‰0.05).

0,Accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure algorithms in healthy adults and in adults with cardiovascular risk factors,"Background Fixed-ratio and slope-based algorithms are used to derive oscillometric blood pressure (BP). However, a paucity of published data exists assessing the accuracy of these methods. Our objective was to determine the accuracy of fixed-ratio and slope-based algorithms in healthy adults and in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. Patients and methods Overall, 85 healthy adults (ageâ‰¥18 years) and 85 adults with cardiovascular risk factors were studied. Three oscillometric and four two-observer mercury-based auscultation measurements were performed in each, according to International Standards Organization 2013 methodology. Two fixed-ratio algorithms and one slope-based algorithm were applied to process oscillometric waveform envelopes and derive oscillometric BP. Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare mean oscillometric BP within and between each group, respectively. Results For healthy adults, mean age was 50.3Â±17.8 years, mean arm circumference was 30.4Â±3.8 cm, and 62% were female. In the cardiovascular risk group, mean age was 63.8Â±12.4 years, mean arm circumference was 31.9Â±4.2 cm, and 62% were female. For systolic BP, the fixed-ratio algorithms produced the lowest mean error and narrowest SD. For diastolic BP, mean errors were similar for all three algorithms, but the fixed-ratio algorithms had higher precision. The comparison of healthy adults and those with cardiovascular risk factor showed high variability for systolic and diastolic BP (SD: 8.113.9 mmHg). Conclusion In both healthy adults and in those with cardiovascular risk factors, the fixed-ratio technique performed better than the slope-based algorithm. High between-group variability indicates that subject-specific algorithms may be needed.","Accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure algorithms in healthy adults and in adults with cardiovascular risk factors.

0,Comparing different supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction,"BACKGROUND: Supervised machine learning algorithms have been a dominant method in the data mining field. Disease prediction using health data has recently shown a potential application area for these methods. This study ai7ms to identify the key trends among different types of supervised machine learning algorithms, and their performance and usage for disease risk prediction. METHODS: In this study, extensive research efforts were made to identify those studies that applied more than one supervised machine learning algorithm on single disease prediction. Two databases (i.e., Scopus and PubMed) were searched for different types of search items. Thus, we selected 48 articles in total for the comparison among variants supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. RESULTS: We found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied most frequently (in 29 studies) followed by the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm (in 23 studies). However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered. CONCLUSION: This study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies.","Comparing different supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction.

However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered. CONCLUSION: This study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies."
0,Maternal exposure to imazalil disrupts the endocrine system in F1 generation mice,"The fungicide imazalil (IMZ), an AR antagonist, has been linked to endocrine disruption in animals. Here, adult female C57BL/6 mice were administered IMZ through their drinking water at levels of 0, 0.025â€° and 0.25â€° during the gestation and lactation periods (the exposed females are marked as F0, and the offspring are marked as F1). Then, we evaluated the physiological, biochemical and gene expression levels in mice after maternal IMZ exposure. The genes involved in sex hormone receptors, cholesterol synthesis and T synthesis were generally inhibited, and the serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were also decreased in the F0 generation female mice. In addition, after F0 IMZ exposure, ovarian androgen receptor (AR) expression was significantly inhibited, and the androgen levels in the serum increased significantly. This may lead to the appearance of progressive virilization during pregnancy. This phenomenon leads to an aromatase deficiency in the F1 generation mice, which results in a decrease in androgen conversion into estrogen and androgen accumulation. In addition, the mRNA expression of key genes and the serum TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels increased in the F1 generation after maternal exposure to IMZ. In addition, testicular TC and LDL-C levels also decreased in the F1 generation male mice. Molecular docking analysis revealed that key hydrogen bonds were formed by nitrogen atoms of the imidazole bonds with Trp751 of the ARs. Our data suggests that maternal IMZ exposure could induce endocrine disruption in the next generation of mice.","Maternal exposure to imazalil disrupts the endocrine system in F1 generation mice.

0,NBS1 interacts with HP1 to ensure genome integrity,"Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex are conserved factors that play crucial role in genome stability and integrity. Despite their involvement in overlapping cellular functions, ranging from chromatin organization, telomere maintenance to DNA replication and repair, a tight functional relationship between HP1 and the MRN complex has never been elucidated. Here we show that the Drosophila HP1a protein binds to the MRN complex through its chromoshadow domain (CSD). In addition, loss of any of the MRN members reduces HP1a levels indicating that the MRN complex acts as regulator of HP1a stability. Moreover, overexpression of HP1a in nbs (but not in rad50 or mre11) mutant cells drastically reduces DNA damage associated with the loss of Nbs suggesting that HP1a and Nbs work in concert to maintain chromosome integrity in flies. We have also found that human HP1Î± and NBS1 interact with each other and that, similarly to Drosophila, siRNA-mediated inhibition of NBS1 reduces HP1Î± levels in human cultured cells. Surprisingly, fibroblasts from Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) patients, carrying the 657del5 hypomorphic mutation in NBS1 and expressing the p26 and p70 NBS1 fragments, accumulate HP1Î± indicating that, differently from NBS1 knockout cells, the presence of truncated NBS1 extends HP1Î± turnover and/or promotes its stability. Remarkably, an siRNA-mediated reduction of HP1Î± in NBS fibroblasts decreases the hypersensitivity to irradiation, a characteristic of the NBS syndrome. Overall, our data provide an unanticipated evidence of a close interaction between HP1 and NBS1 that is essential for genome stability and point up HP1Î± as a potential target to counteract chromosome instability in NBS patient cells.","NBS1 interacts with HP1 to ensure genome integrity.

0,Computer aided quantification of intratumoral stroma yields an independent prognosticator in rectal cancer,"Purpose: Tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) serves as an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer and other solid malignancies. The recent introduction of digital pathology in routine tissue diagnostics holds opportunities for automated TSR analysis. We investigated the potential of computer-aided quantification of intratumoral stroma in rectal cancer whole-slide images. Methods: Histological slides from 129 rectal adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed by two experts who selected a suitable stroma hot-spot and visually assessed TSR. A semi-automatic method based on deep learning was trained to segment all relevant tissue types in rectal cancer histology and subsequently applied to the hot-spots provided by the experts. Patients were assigned to a â€˜stroma-highâ€™ or â€˜stroma-lowâ€™ group by both TSR methods (visual and automated). This allowed for prognostic comparison between the two methods in terms of disease-specific and disease-free survival times. Results: With stroma-low as baseline, automated TSR was found to be prognostic independent of age, gender, pT-stage, lymph node status, tumor grade, and whether adjuvant therapy was given, both for disease-specific survival (hazard ratio = 2.48 (95% confidence interval 1.29â€“4.78)) and for disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.05 (95% confidence interval 1.11â€“3.78)). Visually assessed TSR did not serve as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This work shows that TSR is an independent prognosticator in rectal cancer when assessed automatically in user-provided stroma hot-spots. The deep learning-based technology presented here may be a significant aid to pathologists in routine diagnostics.","Computer aided quantification of intratumoral stroma yields an independent prognosticator in rectal cancer.

0,MiR-204 regulates type 1 IP3R to control vascular smooth muscle cell contractility and blood pressure,"MiR-204 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). However, its role in VSMC contraction is not known. We determined if miR-204 controls VSMC contractility and blood pressure through regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium (Ca2+) release. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and vasoreactivity to VSMC contractile agonists (phenylephrine (PE), thromboxane analogue (U46619), endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensin-II (Ang II) and norepinephrine (NE) were compared in aortas and mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) from miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ mice and wildtype mice (WT). There was no difference in basal systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the two genotypes; however, hypertensive response to Ang II was significantly greater in miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ mice compared to WT mice. Aortas and MRA of miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ mice had heightened contractility to all VSMC agonists. In silico algorithms predicted the type 1 Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) as a target of miR-204. Aortas and MRA of miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ mice had higher expression of IP3R1 compared to WT mice. Difference in agonist-induced vasoconstriction between miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ and WT mice was abolished with pharmacologic inhibition of IP3R1. Furthermore, Ang II-induced aortic IP3R1 was greater in miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ mice compared to WT mice. In addition, difference in aortic vasoconstriction to VSMC agonists between miR-204âˆ’/âˆ’ and WT mice persisted after Ang II infusion. Inhibition of miR-204 in VSMC in vitro increased IP3R1, and boosted SR Ca2+ release in response to PE, while overexpression of miR-204 downregulated IP3R1. Finally, a sequence-specific nucleotide blocker that targets the miR-204-IP3R1 interaction rescued miR-204-induced downregulation of IP3R1. We conclude that miR-204 controls VSMC contractility and blood pressure through IP3R1-dependent regulation of SR calcium release.","MiR-204 regulates type 1 IP3R to control vascular smooth muscle cell contractility and blood pressure.

Comparatively, hippocampal neurons in the adjacent dentate gyrus (DG) survive, suggesting that elucidating the molecular mechanisms underpinning hippocampal sub-regional differences in ischemic tolerance could be central in the development of novel interventions to improve outcome in survivors of forebrain ischemia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that modulate the translation of target genes and have been established as an effective therapeutic target for other models of injury. The objective of the present study was to assess and compare post-injury miRNA profiles between CA1 and DG using a rat model of forebrain ischemia. CA1 and DG sub-regions were dissected from rat hippocampi following 10 min of forebrain ischemia at three time points (3 h, 24 h, and 72 h) and at baseline. Pronounced differences between CA1 and DG were observed for several select miRNAs, including miR-181a-5p, a known regulator of cerebral ischemic injury. We complexed fluorescent in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry to observe cell-type specific and temporal differences in mir-181a-5p expression between CA1 and DG in response to injury. Using established miRNA-mRNA prediction algorithms, we extended our observations in CA1 miRNA dysregulation to identify key functional pathways as potential modulators of CA1 ischemic vulnerability. In summary, our observations support a central role for miRNAs in selective CA1 ischemic vulnerability and suggest that cell-specific miRNA targeting could be a viable clinical approach to preserve CA1 neurons and improve cognitive outcomes for survivors of transient forebrain ischemia.","Hippocampal sub-regional differences in the microRNA response to forebrain ischemia.

0,Stem cells and extracellular vesicles: Biological regulators of physiology and disease,"Many different subpopulations of subcellular extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been described. EVs are released from all cell types and have been shown to regulate normal physiological homeostasis, as well as pathological states by influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, organ homing, injury and recovery, as well as disease progression. In this review, we focus on the bidirectional actions of vesicles from normal and diseased cells on normal or leukemic target cells; and on the leukemic microenvironment as a whole. EVs from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can have a healing effect, reversing the malignant phenotype in prostate and colorectal cancer, as well as mitigating radiation damage to marrow. The role of EVs in leukemia and their bimodal cross talk with the encompassing microenvironment remains to be fully characterized. This may provide insight for clinical advances via the application of EVs as potential therapy and the employment of statistical and machine learning models to capture the pleiotropic effects EVs endow to a dynamic microenvironment, possibly allowing for precise therapeutic intervention.","Stem cells and extracellular vesicles: Biological regulators of physiology and disease.

It is still challenging despite the recent rapid development of genomics and bioinformatics. A typical interpretation workflow includes annotation, filtration, manual inspection and literature review. Those steps are time-consuming and error-prone in the absence of systematic support. Therefore, we developed GTX.Digest.VCF, an online DNA sequencing interpretation system, which prioritizes genes and variants for novel disease-gene relation discovery and integrates text mining results to provide literature evidence for the discovery. Its phenotype-driven ranking and biological data mining approach significantly speed up the whole interpretation process. Results: The GTX.Digest.VCF system is freely available as a web portal at http://vcf.gtxlab.com for academic research. Evaluation on the DDD project dataset demonstrates an accuracy of 77% (235 out of 305 cases) for top-50 genes and an accuracy of 41.6% (127 out of 305 cases) for top-5 genes. Conclusions: GTX.Digest.VCF provides an intelligent web portal for genomics data interpretation via the integration of bioinformatics tools, distributed parallel computing, biomedical text mining. It can facilitate the application of genomic analytics in clinical research and practices.","GTX.Digest.VCF: An online NGS data interpretation system based on intelligent gene ranking and large-scale text mining.

0,Phloretin and phloridzin improve insulin sensitivity and enhance glucose uptake by subverting PPARÎ³/Cdk5 interaction in differentiated adipocytes,"Activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³ agonists) are therapeutically promising candidates against insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Synthetic PPARÎ³ agonists are known to effectively enhance insulin sensitivity, but these are also associated with adverse side-effects and rising cost of treatment. Therefore, natural PPARÎ³ targeting ligands are desirable alternatives for the management of insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes. Phloretin (PT) and Phloridzin (PZ) are predominant apple phenolics, which are recognized for their various pharmacological functions. The present study assessed the potential of PT and PZ in enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by inhibiting Cdk5 activation and corresponding PPARÎ³ phosphorylation in differentiated 3T3L1 cells. In silico docking and subsequent validation using 3T3L1 cells revealed that PT and PZ not only block the ser273 site of PPARÎ³ but also inhibit the activation of Cdk5 itself, thereby, indicating their potent PPARÎ³ regulatory attributes. Corroborating this, application of PT and PZ significantly enhanced the accumulation of cellular triglycerides as well as expression of insulin-sensitizing genes in adipocytes ultimately resulting in improved glucose uptake. Taken together, the present study reports that PT and PZ inhibit Cdk5 activation, which could be directly influencing the apparent PPARÎ³ inhibition at ser273, ultimately resulting in improved insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.","Phloretin and phloridzin improve insulin sensitivity and enhance glucose uptake by subverting PPARÎ³/Cdk5 interaction in differentiated adipocytes.

0,A deep neural network approach to predicting clinical outcomes of neuroblastoma patients,"Background: The availability of high-throughput omics datasets from large patient cohorts has allowed the development of methods that aim at predicting patient clinical outcomes, such as survival and disease recurrence. Such methods are also important to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying disease etiology and development, as well as treatment responses. Recently, different predictive models, relying on distinct algorithms (including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) have been investigated. In this context, deep learning strategies are of special interest due to their demonstrated superior performance over a wide range of problems and datasets. One of the main challenges of such strategies is the ""small n large p"" problem. Indeed, omics datasets typically consist of small numbers of samples and large numbers of features relative to typical deep learning datasets. Neural networks usually tackle this problem through feature selection or by including additional constraints during the learning process. Methods: We propose to tackle this problem with a novel strategy that relies on a graph-based method for feature extraction, coupled with a deep neural network for clinical outcome prediction. The omics data are first represented as graphs whose nodes represent patients, and edges represent correlations between the patients' omics profiles. Topological features, such as centralities, are then extracted from these graphs for every node. Lastly, these features are used as input to train and test various classifiers. Results: We apply this strategy to four neuroblastoma datasets and observe that models based on neural networks are more accurate than state of the art models (DNN: 85%-87%, SVM/RF: 75%-82%). We explore how different parameters and configurations are selected in order to overcome the effects of the small data problem as well as the curse of dimensionality. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the deep neural networks capture complex features in the data that help predicting patient clinical outcomes.","A deep neural network approach to predicting clinical outcomes of neuroblastoma patients.

0,Ear biometrics for patient identification in global health: a field study to test the effectiveness of an image stabilization device in improving identification accuracy,"BACKGROUND: In many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), difficulties in patient identification are a major obstacle to the delivery of longitudinal care. In absence of unique identifiers, biometrics have emerged as an attractive solution to the identification problem. We developed an mHealth App for subject identification using pattern recognition around ear morphology (Project SEARCH (Scanning EARS for Child Health). Early field work with the SEARCH App revealed that image stabilization would be required for optimum performance. METHODS: To improve image capture, we designed and tested a device (the 'Donut'), which standardizes distance, angle, rotation and lighting. We then ran an experimental trial with 194 participants to measure the impact of the Donut on identification rates. Images of the participant's left ear were taken both with and without use of the Donut, then processed by the SEARCH algorithm, measuring the top one and top ten most likely matches. RESULTS: With the Donut, the top one identification rate and top ten identification rates were 99.5 and 99.5%, respectively, vs. 38.4 and 24.1%, respectively, without the Donut (PÂ <â€‰0.0001 for each comparison). In sensitivity analyses, crop technique during pre-processing of images had a powerful impact on identification rates, but this too was facilitated through the Donut. CONCLUSIONS: By standardizing lighting, angle and spatial location of the ear, the Donut achieved near perfect identification rates on a cohort of 194 participants, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of using the ear as a biometric identifier. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study did not include a medical intervention or assess a medical outcome, and therefore did not meet the definition of a human subjects research study as defined by FDAAA. We did not register our study under clinicaltrials.gov .","Ear biometrics for patient identification in global health: a field study to test the effectiveness of an image stabilization device in improving identification accuracy.

0,Co-occurring genomic alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer biology and therapy,"The impressive clinical activity of small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for oncogene-addicted subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (for example, those driven by activating mutations in the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or rearrangements in the genes encoding the receptor tyrosine kinases anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) and rearranged during transfection (RET)) has established an oncogene-centric molecular classification paradigm in this disease. However, recent studies have revealed considerable phenotypic diversity downstream of tumour-initiating oncogenes. Co-occurring genomic alterations, particularly in tumour suppressor genes such as TP53 and LKB1 (also known as STK11), have emerged as core determinants of the molecular and clinical heterogeneity of oncogene-driven lung cancer subgroups through their effects on both tumour cell-intrinsic and non-cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks. In this Review, we discuss the impact of co-mutations on the pathogenesis, biology, microenvironmental interactions and therapeutic vulnerabilities of non-small-cell lung cancer and assess the challenges and opportunities that co-mutations present for personalized anticancer therapy, as well as the expanding field of precision immunotherapy.","Co-occurring genomic alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer biology and therapy.

0,Context-sensitive network analysis identifies food metabolites associated with Alzheimer's disease: An exploratory study,"Background: Diet plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) initiation, progression and outcomes. Previous studies have shown individual food-derived substances may have neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. However, few works systematically investigate the role of food and food-derived metabolites on the development and progression of AD. Methods: In this study, we systematically investigated 7569 metabolites and identified AD-associated food metabolites using a novel network-based approach. We constructed a context-sensitive network to integrate heterogeneous chemical and genetic data, and to model context-specific inter-relationships among foods, metabolites, human genes and AD. Results: Our metabolite prioritization algorithm ranked 59 known AD-associated food metabolites within top 4.9%, which is significantly higher than random expectation. Interestingly, a few top-ranked food metabolites were specifically enriched in herbs and spices. Pathway enrichment analysis shows that these top-ranked herb-and-spice metabolites share many common pathways with AD, including the amyloid processing pathway, which is considered as a hallmark in AD-affected brains and has pathological roles in AD development. Conclusions: Our study represents the first unbiased systems approach to characterizing the effects of food and food-derived metabolites in AD pathogenesis. Our ranking approach prioritizes the known AD-associated food metabolites, and identifies interesting relationships between AD and the food group ""herbs and spices"". Overall, our study provides intriguing evidence for the role of diet, as an important environmental factor, in AD etiology.","Context-sensitive network analysis identifies food metabolites associated with Alzheimer's disease: An exploratory study.

0,Blood group alters platelet binding kinetics to von Willebrand factor and consequently platelet function,"Blood type O is associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. Platelets play a critical role in myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the expression of blood group antigens on platelet proteins alters platelet function; we hypothesized that platelet function would be different between donors with blood type O and those with non-O. To address this hypothesis, we perfused blood from healthy type O donors (n = 33) or non-O donors (n = 54) over pooled plasma derived von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein and purified blood type-specific VWF at arterial shear and measured platelet translocation dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time that type O platelets travel farther at greater speeds before forming stable bonds with VWF. To further characterize these findings, we used a novel analytical model of platelet interaction. Modeling revealed that the kinetics for GPIb/VWF binding rate are significantly lower for type Ocompared with non-Oplatelets. Our results demonstrate that platelets from type O donors interact less with VWF at arterial shear than non-O platelets. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for the reduced risk of myocardial infarction associated with blood type O.","Blood group alters platelet binding kinetics to von Willebrand factor and consequently platelet function.

0,Virtual screen for repurposing of drugs for candidate influenza a M2 ion-channel inhibitors,"Influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 (M2), an ion channel, is crucial for virus infection, and therefore, an important anti-influenza drug target. Adamantanes, also known as M2 channel blockers, are one of the two classes of Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-influenza drugs, although their use was discontinued due to prevalent drug resistance. Fast emergence of resistance to current anti-influenza drugs have raised an urgent need for developing new anti-influenza drugs against resistant forms of circulating viruses. Here we propose a simple theoretical criterion for fast virtual screening of molecular libraries for candidate anti-influenza ion channel inhibitors both for wild type and adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses. After in silico screening of drug space using the EIIP/AQVN filter and further filtering of drugs by ligand based virtual screening and molecular docking we propose the best candidate drugs as potential dual inhibitors of wild type and adamantane-resistant influenza A viruses. Finally, guanethidine, the best ranked drug selected from ligand-based virtual screening, was experimentally tested. The experimental results show measurable anti-influenza activity of guanethidine in cell culture.","Virtual screen for repurposing of drugs for candidate influenza a M2 ion-channel inhibitors.

0,Identification of esophageal cancer pathway deviation and construction of a diagnosis model using three kernel genes,"The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of interleukin 35 (IL35) in esophageal carcinoma by comparing the mRNA level in Barrett's esophageal mucosa and in matched normal squamous mucosa and to understand how the diagnosis model works with two other genes: hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (HNF1B) and cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1). By comparing carcinoma tissue and normal tissue samples, we extracted all the differentially expressed mRNAs. The bioinformatics analysis resulted in the discovery of three prominent genes. Eventually, the three genes were utilized to train a deep-learning model. An additional wet experiment was conducted to validate the effect of IL35. All the differentially expressed genes were enriched into nine groups, each of which has specific biological functions. Given that the three significant genes HNF1B, CREB3L1, and IL35 as diagnostic features, a deep-learning model was constructed, reaching an accuracy of 93% in the training set and 87% in the test set. Our findings suggest that IL35, along with the other two signatures, can distinguish esophageal tumor samples from normal samples precisely.","Identification of esophageal cancer pathway deviation and construction of a diagnosis model using three kernel genes.

0,Rome Foundation Working Team Report on Post-Infection Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The existence of postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) has been substantiated by epidemiology studies conducted in diverse geographic and clinical settings. However, the available evidence has not been well summarized, and there is little guidance for diagnosis and treatment of PI-IBS. The ROME Foundation has produced a working team report to summarize the available evidence on the pathophysiology of PI-IBS and provide guidance for diagnosis and treatment, based on findings reported in the literature and clinical experience. METHODS: The working team conducted an evidence-based review of publication databases for articles describing the clinical features (diagnosis), pathophysiology (intestinal sensorimotor function, microbiota, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction, enteroendocrine pathways, and genetics), and animal models of PI-IBS. We used a Delphi-based consensus system to create guidelines for management of PI-IBS and a developed treatment algorithm based on published findings and experiences of team members. RESULTS: PI-IBS develops in about 10% of patients with infectious enteritis. Risk factors include female sex, younger age, psychological distress during or before acute gastroenteritis, and severity of the acute episode. The pathogenesis of PI-PBS appears to involve changes in the intestinal microbiome as well as epithelial, serotonergic, and immune system factors. However, these mechanisms are incompletely understood. There are no evidence-based, effective pharmacologic strategies for treatment of PI-IBS. We provide a consensus-based treatment algorithm, based on clinical presentation and potential disease mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a systematic review of the literature and team experience, we summarize the clinical features, pathophysiology (from animal models and human studies), and progression of PI-IBS. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of PI-IBS based on team consensus. We also propose areas for future investigation.","Rome Foundation Working Team Report on Post-Infection Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

0,Digital pathology imaging and computer-aided diagnostics as a novel tool for standardization of evaluation of aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease) histopathology,"Based on a recently introduced immunohistochemical panel (Bachmann et al. 2015) for aganglionic megacolon (AM), also known as Hirschsprung disease, histopathological diagnosis, we evaluated whether the use of digital pathology and â€˜machine learningâ€™ could help to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Slides were obtained from 31 specimens of 27 patients immunohistochemically stained for MAP2, calretinin, S100Î² and GLUT1. Slides were digitized by whole slide scanning. We used a Definiens Developer Tissue Studios as software for analysis. We configured necessary parameters in combination with â€˜machine learningâ€™ to identify pathological aberrations. A significant difference between AM- and non-AM-affected tissues was found for calretinin (AM 0.55% vs. non-AM 1.44%) and MAP2 (AM 0.004% vs. non-AM 0.07%) staining measurements and software-based evaluations. In contrast, S100Î² and GLUT1 staining measurements and software-based evaluations showed no significant differences between AM- and non-AM-affected tissues. However, no difference was found in comparison of suction biopsies with resections. Applying machine learning via an ensemble voting classifier, we achieved an accuracy of 87.5% on the test set. Automated diagnosis of AM by applying digital pathology on immunohistochemical panels was successful for calretinin and MAP2, whereas S100Î² and GLUT1 were not effective in diagnosis. Our method suggests that software-based approaches are capable of diagnosing AM. Our future challenge will be the improvement of efficiency by reduction of the time-consuming need for large pre-labelled training data. With increasing technical improvement, especially in unsupervised training procedures, this method could be helpful in the future.","Digital pathology imaging and computer-aided diagnostics as a novel tool for standardization of evaluation of aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease) histopathology.

0,Defining skin cancer local recurrence,"Definitions of skin cancer recurrence are variable and nonstandardized, which can lead to inconsistent and potentially inappropriate management of tumors of uncertain recurrence status. Defining recurrence is important given the potential association with metastasis in both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. A review of the literature across multiple disciplines involved in the care of skin cancer patients reveals that although criteria for recurrence are provided in the majority of cases, most are vague and inconsistent. Given the presumably increased morbidity and mortality associated with recurrent tumors, accurate identification and appropriate management is paramount. In addition, value-based health care necessitates validated and relevant outcome measures that are standardized and, thus, enable tracking of comparable and corresponding outcomes. A universal definition of localized skin cancer recurrence would ultimately allow for improved surveillance and informed therapeutic strategies to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients afflicted with skin cancer, the most common cancer nationwide.","Defining skin cancer local recurrence.

0,TAS-120 overcomes resistance to atp-competitive FGFR inhibitors in patients with FGFR2 fusionâ€“positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,"ATP-competitive fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitors, including BGJ398 and Debio 1347, show antitumor activity in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) harboring activating FGFR2 gene fusions. Unfortunately, acquired resistance develops and is often associated with the emergence of secondary FGFR2 kinase domain mutations. Here, we report that the irreversible pan-FGFR inhibitor TAS-120 demonstrated efficacy in 4 patients with FGFR2 fusionâ€“positive ICC who developed resistance to BGJ398 or Debio 1347. Examination of serial biopsies, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and patient-derived ICC cells revealed that TAS-120 was active against multiple FGFR2 mutations conferring resistance to BGJ398 or Debio 1347. Functional assessment and modeling the clonal outgrowth of individual resistance mutations from polyclonal cell pools mirrored the resistance profiles observed clinically for each inhibitor. Our findings suggest that strategic sequencing of FGFR inhibitors, guided by serial biopsy and ctDNA analysis, may prolong the duration of benefit from FGFR inhibition in patients with FGFR2 fusionâ€“positive ICC. SIGNIFICANCE: ATP-competitive FGFR inhibitors (BGJ398, Debio 1347) show efficacy in FGFR2-altered ICC; however, acquired FGFR2 kinase domain mutations cause drug resistance and tumor progression. We demonstrate that the irreversible FGFR inhibitor TAS-120 provides clinical benefit in patients with resistance to BGJ398 or Debio 1347 and overcomes several FGFR2 mutations in ICC models.","TAS-120 overcomes resistance to atp-competitive FGFR inhibitors in patients with FGFR2 fusionâ€“positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

The prime focus of the field has recently been on the study of highly purified hematopoietic stem cells using various lineage and stem cell-specific markers, all of which adequately and conveniently fit the established hierarchical stem cell model. This methodology is tainted with bias and has led to incomplete conclusions. Much of our own work has shown that the purified hematopoietic stem cell, which has been so heavily studied, is not representative of the total population of hematopoietic stem cells and that rather than functioning within a hierarchical model of expansion the true hematopoietic stem cell is one that is actively cycling through various differentiation potentials within a dynamic continuum. Additional work with increased emphasis on studying whole populations and direct mechanistic studies to these populations is needed. Furthermore, the most productive studies may well be mechanistic at the cellular or tissue levels. Lastly, the application of robust machine learning algorithms may provide insight into the dynamic variability and flux of stem cell fate and differentiation potential.","Heuristic bias in stem cell biology.

0,Alleviation of exhaustion-induced immunosuppression and sepsis by immune checkpoint blockers sequentially administered with antibioticsâ€”analysis of a new mathematical model,"Background: Sepsis-associated immune dysregulation, involving hyper-inflammation and immunosuppression, is common in intensive care patients, often leading to multiple organ dysfunction and death. The aim of this study was to identify the main driving force underlying immunosuppression in sepsis, and to suggest new therapeutic avenues for controlling this immune impairment and alleviating excessive pathogen load. Methods: We developed two minimalistic (skeletal) mathematical models of pathogen-associated inflammation, which focus on the dynamics of myeloid, lymphocyte, and pathogen numbers in blood. Both models rely on the assumption that the presence of the pathogen causes a bias in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation toward the myeloid developmental line. Also in one of the models, we assumed that continuous exposure to pathogens induces lymphocyte exhaustion. In addition, weÂ also created therapy models, both by antibiotics and byÂ immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Assuming realistic parameter ranges, we simulated the pathogen-associated inflammation models in silico with or without various antibiotic and immunotherapy schedules. Results: Computer simulations of the two models show that the assumption of lymphocyte exhaustion is a prerequisite for attaining sepsis-associatedÂ immunosuppression, and that the ability of the innate and adaptive immune systems to control infections depends on the pathogenâ€™s replication rate. Simulation results further show that combining antibiotics with immune checkpoint blockers can suffice for defeating even an aggressive pathogen within a relatively short period. This is so as long as the drugs are administered soon after diagnosis. In contrast, when applied as monotherapies, antibiotics or immune checkpoint blockers fall short of eliminating aggressive pathogens in reasonable time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that lymphocyte exhaustion crucially drives immunosuppression in sepsis, and that one can efficiently resolve both immunosuppression and pathogenesis by timely coupling ofÂ antibiotics with an immune checkpoint blocker, but not by either one of these two treatment modalities alone. Following experimental validation, our model can be adapted to explore the potential of other therapeutic options in this field.","Alleviation of exhaustion-induced immunosuppression and sepsis by immune checkpoint blockers sequentially administered with antibioticsâ€”analysis of a new mathematical model.

Simulation results further show that combining antibiotics with immune checkpoint blockers can suffice for defeating even an aggressive pathogen within a relatively short period. This is so as long as the drugs are administered soon after diagnosis. In contrast, when applied as monotherapies, antibiotics or immune checkpoint blockers fall short of eliminating aggressive pathogens in reasonable time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that lymphocyte exhaustion crucially drives immunosuppression in sepsis, and that one can efficiently resolve both immunosuppression and pathogenesis by timely coupling ofÂ antibiotics with an immune checkpoint blocker, but not by either one of these two treatment modalities alone. Following experimental validation, our model can be adapted to explore the potential of other therapeutic options in this field."
0,Epitope-based immunoinformatics approach on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein complex of Nipah virus (NiV),"Persistent outbreaks of Nipah virus (NiV) with severe case fatality throw a major challenge on researchers to develop a drug or vaccine to combat the disease. With little knowledge of its molecular mechanisms, we utilized the proteome data of NiV to evaluate the potency of three major proteins (phosphoprotein, polymerase, and nucleocapsid protein) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex to count as a possible candidate for epitope-based vaccine design. Profound computational analysis was used on the above proteins individually to explore the T-cell immune properties like antigenicity, immunogenicity, binding to major histocompatibility complex class I and class II alleles, conservancy, toxicity, and population coverage. Based on these predictions the peptide â€˜ELRSELIGYâ€™ of phosphoprotein and â€˜YPLLWSFAMâ€™ of nulceocapsid protein were identified as the best-predicted T-cell epitopes and molecular docking with human leukocyte antigen-C (HLA-C*12:03) molecule was effectuated followed by validation with molecular dynamics simulation. The B-cell epitope predictions suggest that the sequence positions 421 to 471 in phosphoprotein, 606 to 640 in polymerase and 496 to 517 in nucleocapsid protein are the best-predicted regions for B-cell immune response. However, the further experimental circumstance is required to test and validate the efficacy of the subunit peptide for potential candidacy against NiV.","Epitope-based immunoinformatics approach on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein complex of Nipah virus (NiV).

0,A computational method to characterize the missense mutations in the catalytic domain of GAA protein causing Pompe disease,"Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by acid Î±-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen, including cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. The GAA gene is located on chromosome 17 (17q25.3), the GAA protein consists of 952 amino acids; of which 378 amino acids (347-726) falls within the catalytic domain of the protein and comprises of active sites (518 and 521) and binding sites (404, 600, 616, and 674). In this study, we used several computational tools to classify the missense mutations in the catalytic domain of GAA for their pathogenicity and stability. Eight missense mutations (R437C, G478R, N573H, Y575S, G605D, V642D, L705P, and L712P) were predicted to be pathogenic and destabilizing to the protein structure. These mutations were further subjected to phenotyping analysis using SNPeffect 4.0 to predict the chaperone binding sites and structural stability of the protein. The mutations R437C and G478R were found to compromise the chaperone-binding activity with GAA. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the G478R mutation to be more significant and hinders binding to the DNJ (Miglustat) compared with the R437C. Further molecular dynamic analysis for the two mutations demonstrated that the G478R mutation was acquired higher deviation, fluctuation, and lower compactness with decreased intramolecular hydrogen bonds compared to the mutant R437C. These data are expected to serve as a platform for drug design against Pompe disease and will serve as an ultimate tool for variant classification and interpretations.","A computational method to characterize the missense mutations in the catalytic domain of GAA protein causing Pompe disease.

In here, a molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation was performed using the crystal structure of human AGO2 protein complex with miR-20a. miR-20a is involved with various kind of biological process like heart and lung development, oncogenic process, etc. In precise, MD simulation was carried out with AGO2 protein complex with wild type, two mutant sites and four mutant sites in guided microRNA (miRNA). It has been noted that root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions of nucleic acid for wild type and two mutant sites guided miRNA has the same pattern of fluctuations, which stabilizes around 0.27 nm after 2 ns. CÎ± atom of AGO2 protein in the complex shows that this complex with wild type and two mutant site mutation duplex has a stable RMSD value after 20 ns, ranging between 0.14 and 0.21 nm. From the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), we observed an increased pattern of fluctuations for the atoms of four mutant complex of AGO2-miR-20a complex. This increased RMSF of non-mutated nucleic acids is contributed by U-A bond breaking at the site of the nucleotide of U2 of guided miRNA, as observed from the duplex structure taken at different time steps of the simulation. Superimposed structure of the miRNA-mRNA duplex for the three complexes depicts that the three miRNA-mRNA duplexes are stable during the simulation. Current work demonstrates the possible correlations between the conformational changes of this AGO2-miR-20a duplex structure and the interactions of different atoms.","Understanding the molecular interaction of human argonaute-2 and miR-20a complex: A molecular dynamics approach.

0,Diagnosing growth in low-grade gliomas with and without longitudinal volume measurements: A retrospective observational study,"Background Low-grade gliomas cause significant neurological morbidity by brain invasion. There is no universally accepted objective technique available for detection of enlargement of low-grade gliomas in the clinical setting; subjective evaluation by clinicians using visual comparison of longitudinal radiological studies is the gold standard. The aim of this study is to determine whether a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) method helps physicians detect earlier growth of low-grade gliomas. Methods and findings We reviewed 165 patients diagnosed with grade 2 gliomas, seen at the University of Alabama at Birmingham clinics from 1 July 2017 to 14 May 2018. MRI scans were collected during the spring and summer of 2018. Fifty-six gliomas met the inclusion criteria, including 19 oligodendrogliomas, 26 astrocytomas, and 11 mixed gliomas in 30 males and 26 females with a mean age of 48 years and a range of follow-up of 150.2 months (difference between highest and lowest values). None received radiation therapy. We also studied 7 patients with an imaging abnormality without pathological diagnosis, who were clinically stable at the time of retrospective review (14 May 2018). This study compared growth detection by 7 physicians aided by the CAD method with retrospective clinical reports. The tumors of 63 patients (56 + 7) in 627 MRI scans were digitized, including 34 grade 2 gliomas with radiological progression and 22 radiologically stable grade 2 gliomas. The CAD method consisted of tumor segmentation, computing volumes, and pointing to growth by the online abrupt change-of-point method, which considers only past measurements. Independent scientists have evaluated the segmentation method. In 29 of the 34 patients with progression, the median time to growth detection was only 14 months for CAD compared to 44 months for current standard of care radiological evaluation (p < 0.001). Using CAD, accurate detection of tumor enlargement was possible with a median of only 57% change in the tumor volume as compared to a median of 174% change of volume necessary to diagnose tumor growth using standard of care clinical methods (p < 0.001). In the radiologically stable group, CAD facilitated growth detection in 13 out of 22 patients. CAD did not detect growth in the imaging abnormality group. The main limitation of this study was its retrospective design; nevertheless, the results depict the current state of a gold standard in clinical practice that allowed a significant increase in tumor volumes from baseline before detection. Such large increases in tumor volume would not be permitted in a prospective design. The number of glioma patients (n = 56) is a limitation; however, it is equivalent to the number of patients in phase II clinical trials. Conclusions The current practice of visual comparison of longitudinal MRI scans is associated with significant delays in detecting growth of low-grade gliomas. Our findings support the idea that physicians aided by CAD detect growth at significantly smaller volumes than physicians using visual comparison alone. This study does not answer the questions whether to treat or not and which treatment modality is optimal. Nonetheless, early growth detection sets the stage for future clinical studies that address these questions and whether early therapeutic interventions prolong survival and improve quality of life.","Diagnosing growth in low-grade gliomas with and without longitudinal volume measurements: A retrospective observational study.

0,Phenotypic Screening Combined with Machine Learning for Efficient Identification of Breast Cancer-Selective Therapeutic Targets,"The lack of functional understanding of most mutations in cancer, combined with the non-druggability of most proteins, challenge genomics-based identification of oncology drug targets. We implemented a machine-learning-based approach (idTRAX), which relates cell-based screening of small-molecule compounds to their kinase inhibition data, to directly identify effective and readily druggable targets. We applied idTRAX to triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and efficiently identified cancer-selective targets. For example, we found that inhibiting AKT selectively kills MFM-223 and CAL148 cells, while inhibiting FGFR2 only kills MFM-223. Since the effects of catalytically inhibiting a protein can diverge from those of reducing its levels, targets identified by idTRAX frequently differ from those identified through gene knockout/knockdown methods. This is critical if the purpose is to identify targets specifically for small-molecule drug development, whereby idTRAX may produce fewer false-positives. The rapid nature of the approach suggests that it may be applicable in personalizing therapy.","Phenotypic Screening Combined with Machine Learning for Efficient Identification of Breast Cancer-Selective Therapeutic Targets.

0,Longitudinal engagement trajectories and risk of death among new ART starters in Zambia: A group-based multi-trajectory analysis,"BACKGROUND: Retention in HIV treatment must be improved to advance the HIV response, but research to characterize gaps in retention has focused on estimates from single time points and population-level averages. These approaches do not assess the engagement patterns of individual patients over time and fail to account for both their dynamic nature and the heterogeneity between patients. We apply group-based trajectory analysis-a special application of latent class analysis to longitudinal data-among new antiretroviral therapy (ART) starters in Zambia to identify groups defined by engagement patterns over time and to assess their association with mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed a cohort of HIV-infected adults who newly started ART between August 1, 2013, and February 1, 2015, across 64 clinics in Zambia. We performed group-based multi-trajectory analysis to identify subgroups with distinct trajectories in medication possession ratio (MPR, a validated adherence metric based on pharmacy refill data) over the past 3 months and loss to follow-up (LTFU, >90 days late for last visit) among patients with at least 180 days of observation time. We used multinomial logistic regression to identify baseline factors associated with belonging to particular trajectory groups. We obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates with bootstrapped confidence intervals of the cumulative incidence of mortality stratified by trajectory group and performed adjusted Poisson regression to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) for mortality by trajectory group. Inverse probability weights were applied to all analyses to account for updated outcomes ascertained from tracing a random subset of patients lost to follow-up as of July 31, 2015. Overall, 38,879 patients (63.3% female, median age 35 years [IQR 29-41], median enrollment CD4 count 280 cells/mul [IQR 146-431]) were included in our cohort. Analyses revealed 6 trajectory groups among the new ART starters: (1) 28.5% of patients demonstrated consistently high adherence and retention; (2) 22.2% showed early nonadherence but consistent retention; (3) 21.6% showed gradually decreasing adherence and retention; (4) 8.6% showed early LTFU with later reengagement; (5) 8.7% had early LTFU without reengagement; and (6) 10.4% had late LTFU without reengagement. Identified groups exhibited large differences in survival: after adjustment, the ""early LTFU with reengagement"" group (aIRR 3.4 [95% CI 1.2-9.7], p = 0.019), the ""early LTFU"" group (aIRR 6.4 [95% CI 2.5-16.3], p < 0.001), and the ""late LTFU"" group (aIRR 4.7 [95% CI 2.0-11.3], p = 0.001) had higher rates of mortality as compared to the group with consistently high adherence/retention. Limitations of this study include using data observed after baseline to identify trajectory groups and to classify patients into these groups, excluding patients who died or transferred within the first 180 days, and the uncertain generalizability of the data to current care standards. CONCLUSIONS: Among new ART starters in Zambia, we observed 6 patient subgroups that demonstrated distinctive engagement trajectories over time and that were associated with marked differences in the subsequent risk of mortality. Further efforts to develop tailored intervention strategies for different types of engagement behaviors, monitor early engagement to identify higher-risk patients, and better understand the determinants of these heterogeneous behaviors can help improve care delivery and survival in this population.","Longitudinal engagement trajectories and risk of death among new ART starters in Zambia: A group-based multi-trajectory analysis.

This study provides practical insight into this topic by experimentally measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuroreceptor binding using simultaneous PET/MRI. Hypercapnic challenges (7% CO2) were administered to non-human primates in order to induce controlled increases in CBF, measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling. Simultaneously, dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding of [11C]raclopride or [18F]fallypride was monitored with dynamic PET. Experiments showed that neither time activity curves nor quantification of binding through binding potentials (BPND) were measurably affected by CBF increases, which were larger than two-fold. Simulations of experimental procedures showed that even large changes in CBF should have little effect on the time activity curves of radiotracers, given a set of realistic assumptions. The proposed method can be applied to experimentally assess the flow sensitivity of other radiotracers. Results demonstrate that CBF changes, which often occur due to behavioral tasks or pharmacological challenges, do not affect PET [11C]raclopride or [18F]fallypride binding studies and their quantification. The results from this study suggest flow effects may have limited impact on many PET neuroreceptor tracers with similar properties.","Effects of flow changes on radiotracer binding: Simultaneous measurement of neuroreceptor binding and cerebral blood flow modulation.

0,A Review of and Algorithmic Approach to Soft Palate Reconstruction,"Importance: The soft palate contributes to deglutition, articulation, and respiration. Current reconstructive techniques focus on restoration of both form and function. The unique challenges of soft palate reconstruction include maintenance of complex upper aerodigestive tract function, with minimal local or donor site morbidity. Objective: To review the literature on soft palate reconstruction and present an algorithm on how to approach soft palate defects based on this review. Evidence Review: A review of the literature for articles reporting studies on and that described concepts related to soft palate reconstruction was conducted in March 2017. In all, 1804 candidate titles and abstracts were independently reviewed. English-language articles that discussed acquired soft palate defect reconstruction were included. Non-English language studies without available translations, studies on primary soft palate defect reconstruction (ie, cleft palate repair) and primary cleft palate repair, studies in which the soft palate was not the focus of the article, and studies involving animals were excluded. Findings: The following observations were made from the review of 92 included articles. Soft palate anatomy is a complex interplay of multiple structures working in a 3-dimensional area. Three of the authors created an initial algorithmic framework based on the selected studies. After this, a round table discussion among 3 authors considered experts was used to refine the algorithm based on their expert opinion. The 4 most important factors were determined to be defect size, defect extension to other subsites, defect thickness, and history of radiotherapy or planned radiotherapy. This algorithm includes both surgical and nonsurgical options. Defects in the soft palate not only affect the size and shape of the organ but, more critically, the function. The reconstructive ladder is used to help maximize the remaining soft palate functional tissue and minimize the effect of nonfunctional implanted tissue. Partial-thickness defects or defects less than one-fourth of the soft palate may not require locoregional tissue transfer. Patients with a history of radiotherapy or defects of up to 75% of the soft palate may require locoregional tissue transfer. Defects greater than 75% of the soft palate, defects that include exposure of the neck vasculature, or defects that include significant portions of the hard palate or adjacent oropharyngeal subsites may require free tissue transfer. Obturation should be considered a second-line option in most cases. Conclusions and Relevance: Ideal reconstruction of the soft palate relies on a comprehensive understanding of soft palate anatomy, a full consideration of the armamentarium of surgical techniques, consideration for adjacent subsite deficits, and a detailed knowledge of various intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors to optimize speech, swallowing, and airway outcomes. The included algorithm may serve as a useful starting point for the surgeon when considering reconstruction.","A Review of and Algorithmic Approach to Soft Palate Reconstruction. Importance: The soft palate contributes to deglutition, articulation, and respiration. Current reconstructive techniques focus on restoration of both form and function. The unique challenges of soft palate reconstruction include maintenance of complex upper aerodigestive tract function, with minimal local or donor site morbidity. Objective: To review the literature on soft palate reconstruction and present an algorithm on how to approach soft palate defects based on this review. Evidence Review: A review of the literature for articles reporting studies on and that described concepts related to soft palate reconstruction was conducted in March 2017. In all, 1804 candidate titles and abstracts were independently reviewed. English-language articles that discussed acquired soft palate defect reconstruction were included. Non-English language studies without available translations, studies on primary soft palate defect reconstruction (ie, cleft palate repair) and primary cleft palate repair, studies in which the soft palate was not the focus of the article, and studies involving animals were excluded. Findings: The following observations were made from the review of 92 included articles. Soft palate anatomy is a complex interplay of multiple structures working in a 3-dimensional area. Three of the authors created an initial algorithmic framework based on the selected studies. After this, a round table discussion among 3 authors considered experts was used to refine the algorithm based on their expert opinion. The 4 most important factors were determined to be defect size, defect extension to other subsites, defect thickness, and history of radiotherapy or planned radiotherapy. This algorithm includes both surgical and nonsurgical options. Defects in the soft palate not only affect the size and shape of the organ but, more critically, the function. The reconstructive ladder is used to help maximize the remaining soft palate functional tissue and minimize the effect of nonfunctional implanted tissue. Partial-thickness defects or defects less than one-fourth of the soft palate may not require locoregional tissue transfer. Patients with a history of radiotherapy or defects of up to 75% of the soft palate may require locoregional tissue transfer. Defects greater than 75% of the soft palate, defects that include exposure of the neck vasculature, or defects that include significant portions of the hard palate or adjacent oropharyngeal subsites may require free tissue transfer. Obturation should be considered a second-line option in most cases. Conclusions and Relevance: Ideal reconstruction of the soft palate relies on a comprehensive understanding of soft palate anatomy, a full consideration of the armamentarium of surgical techniques, consideration for adjacent subsite deficits, and a detailed knowledge of various intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors to optimize speech, swallowing, and airway outcomes. The included algorithm may serve as a useful starting point for the surgeon when considering reconstruction."

We investigated the transcription of genes involved in maturation and fibrosis in postnatal hepatocytes of mice, focusing on the chromatin compaction the roles of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2. METHODS: Hepatocytes were isolated from mixed background C57BL/6J-C3H mice, as well as mice with liver-specific disruption of Ezh1 and/or Ezh2, at postnatal day 14 and 2 months after birth. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by RNA sequencing, H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and sonication-resistant heterochromatin sequencing (a method to map heterochromatin and euchromatin). Liver damage was characterized by histologic analysis. RESULTS: We found more than 3000 genes differentially expressed in hepatocytes during liver maturation from postnatal day 14 to month 2 after birth. Disruption of Ezh1 and Ezh2 in livers caused perinatal hepatocytes to differentiate prematurely and to express genes at postnatal day 14 that would normally be induced by month 2 and differentiate prematurely. Loss of Ezh1 and Ezh2 also resulted in liver fibrosis. Genes with H3K27me3-postive and H3K4me3-positive euchromatic promoters were prematurely induced in hepatocytes with loss of Ezh1 and Ezh2-these genes included those that regulate hepatocyte maturation, fibrosis, and genes not specifically associated with the liver lineage. CONCLUSIONS: The Polycomb repressive complex 2 proteins EZH1 and EZH2 regulate genes that control hepatocyte maturation and fibrogenesis and genes not specifically associated with the liver lineage by acting at euchromatic promoter regions. EZH1 and EZH2 thereby promote liver homeostasis and prevent liver damage. Strategies to manipulate Polycomb proteins might be used to improve hepatocyte derivation protocols or developed for treatment of patients with liver fibrosis.","Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Proteins EZH1 and EZH2 Regulate Timing of Postnatal Hepatocyte Maturation and Fibrosis by Repressing Genes With Euchromatic Promoters in Mice.

0,Simplified clinical algorithm for identifying patients eligible for same-day HIV treatment initiation (SLATE): Results from an individually randomized trial in South Africa and Kenya,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends ""same-day"" initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV patients who are eligible and ready. Identifying efficient, safe, and feasible procedures for determining same-day eligibility and readiness is now a priority. The Simplified Algorithm for Treatment Eligibility (SLATE) study evaluated a clinical algorithm that allows healthcare workers to determine eligibility for same-day treatment and to initiate ART at the patient's first clinic visit. METHODS AND FINDINGS: SLATE was an individually randomized trial at three outpatient clinics in urban settlements in Johannesburg, South Africa and three hospital clinics in western Kenya. Adult, nonpregnant, HIV-positive, ambulatory patients presenting for any HIV care, including HIV testing, but not yet on ART were enrolled and randomized to the SLATE algorithm arm or standard care. The SLATE algorithm used four screening tools-a symptom self-report, medical history questionnaire, physical examination, and readiness assessment-to ascertain eligibility for same-day initiation or refer for further care. Follow-up was by record review, and analysis was conducted by country. We report primary outcomes of 1) ART initiation </=28 days and 2) initiation </=28 days and retention in care </=8 months of enrollment. From March 7, 2017 to April 17, 2018, we enrolled 600 patients (median [IQR] age 34 [29-40] and CD4 count 286 [128-490]; 63% female) in South Africa and 477 patients in Kenya (median [IQR] age 35 [29-43] and CD4 count 283 [117-541]; 58% female). In the intervention arm, 78% of patients initiated </=28 days in South Africa, compared to 68% in the standard arm (risk difference [RD] [95% confidence interval (CI)] 10% [3%-17%]); in Kenya, 94% of intervention-arm patients initiated </=28 days compared to 89% in the standard arm (6% [0.5%-11%]). By 8 months in South Africa, 161/298 (54%) intervention-arm patients had initiated and were retained, compared to 146/302 (48%) in the standard arm (6% [(2% to 14%]). By 8 months in Kenya, the corresponding retention outcomes were identical in both arms (137/240 [57%] of intervention-arm patients and 136/237 [57%] of standard-arm patients). Limitations of the trial included limited geographic representativeness, exclusion of patients too ill to participate, missing viral load data, greater study fidelity to the algorithm than might be achieved in standard care, and secular changes in standard care over the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In South Africa, the SLATE algorithm increased uptake of ART within 28 days by 10% and showed a numerical increase (6%) in retention at 8 months. In Kenya, the algorithm increased uptake of ART within 28 days by 6% but found no difference in retention at 8 months. Eight-month retention was poor in both arms and both countries. These results suggest that a simple structured algorithm for same-day treatment initiation procedures is feasible and can increase and accelerate ART uptake but that early retention on treatment remains problematic.

0,Association of Prepubertal and Postpubertal Exposure to Childhood Maltreatment with Adult Amygdala Function,"Importance: Abnormalities in amygdala response to threatening faces have been observed in anxiety disorders, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormally hyperactive and hypoactive responses have typically been associated with anxiety and inhibition vs risk taking and inappropriate social behaviors. Maltreatment is a major risk factor for most of these disorders and is associated with abnormal amygdala function. Objective: To identify the type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment that are associated with hyperactive and hypoactive amygdala responses in young adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data collection for this retrospective cohort study took place from November 8, 2010, to August 23, 2012. Data analyses were conducted from September 20, 2012, to June 27, 2018. Participants were recruited from the urban and suburban Boston vicinity without diagnostic restrictions based on exposure history. Exposures: The Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale was used to retrospectively assess type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Activation and pattern information functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess bilateral amygdala response to angry and fearful faces vs neutral faces or shapes, and sensitive exposure periods were identified using cross-validated artificial intelligence predictive analytics (50 averaged randomized iterations with training on 63.3% and testing on 36.7% of the sample). Results: Of the 202 participants (mean [SD] age, 23.2 [1.7] years; 118 [58.4%] female), 52 (25.7%) reported no exposure to maltreatment and 150 (74.3%) reported exposure to 1 or more maltreatment types. Eight participants (15.1%) with a MACE score of 0 and 51 (34.2%) with a MACE score of 1 or higher had a history of major depression (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.05-6.06; P =.03); 8 unexposed participants (15.1%) and 46 with MACE scores of 1 or higher (30.9%) had a history of 1 or more anxiety disorders (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.03-6.50; P =.03). Retrospective self-report of physical maltreatment between 3 and 6 years of age and peer emotional abuse at 13 and 15 years were associated with amygdala activation to emotional faces vs shapes. Early exposure was associated with blunted response (Î² = -0.17, P <.001), whereas later exposure was associated with augmented response (Î² = 0.16, P <.001). Prepubertal vs postpubertal maltreatment was associated with an opposite response on the voxelwise response pattern in clustering stimuli of the same type (eg, mean [SD] emotional ellipse areas for physical maltreatment at age 4 years vs nonverbal emotional abuse at 13 years: 1.41 [1.05] vs 0.25 [0.10], P <.001) and in distinguishing between stimuli of different types (eg, mean [SD] emotional vs neutral faces distance for peer emotional abuse at age 6 years vs 13 years: 1.89 [0.75] vs 0.80 [0.39], P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that prepubertal vs postpubertal developmental differences in the association between maltreatment and amygdala response to threatening or salient stimuli exist. Understanding the role of adversity in different sensitive exposure periods and the potential adaptive significance of attenuated vs enhanced amygdala response may help explain why maltreatment may be a risk factor for many different disorders and foster creation of targeted interventions to preempt the emergence of psychopathology in at-risk youths..","Association of Prepubertal and Postpubertal Exposure to Childhood Maltreatment with Adult Amygdala Function.

0,Next-generation sequencing with comprehensive bioinformatics analysis facilitates somatic mosaic APC gene mutation detection in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis,"Background: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant colorectal tumor characterized by numerous adenomatous colonic polyps that often lead to colon cancer. Although most patients with FAP harbored germline mutations in APC gene, it was recently recognized that patients with clinical FAP, but without detectable pathogenic mutations, could be associated with somatic mosaic APC mutation. Methods: We reanalyzed the nest-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel testing results of patients who were diagnosed with FAP, but did not have APC mutations, at Yonsei Cancer Prevention Center between July 2016 and March 2018. We tested several variant calling algorithms to identify low level mosaic variants. In one patient with a low frequency APC mutation, NGS analysis was performed together with endoscopic biopsy. Variant calling tools HaplotypeCaller, MuTect2, VarScan2, and Pindel were used. We also used 3â€²-Modified Oligonucleotides (MEMO)-PCR or conventional PCR for confirmation. Results: Among 28 patients with clinical suspicion of FAP but no detectable pathogenic variants of colonic polyposis associated genes, somatic mosaic pathogenic variants were identified in seven patients. The variant allele frequency ranged from 0.3 to 7.7%. These variants were mostly detected through variant caller MuTect2 and Pindel, and were further confirmed using mutant enrichment with MEMO-PCR. Conclusions: The NGS with an adequate combination of bioinformatics tools is effective to detect low level somatic variants in a single assay. Because mosaic APC mutations are more frequent than previously thought, the presence of mosaic mutations must be considered when analyzing genetic tests of patients with FAP.","Next-generation sequencing with comprehensive bioinformatics analysis facilitates somatic mosaic APC gene mutation detection in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.

The synaptic loss and dysfunction leading to failures of synaptic networks in AD brain directly cause cognitive deficits of patient. However, it remains unclear whether the synaptic networks in AD brain could be repaired. In this study, we generated functional human induced neural progenitor/stem cells (iNPCs) that had been transplanted into the hippocampus of immunodeficient wild-type and AD mice. The grafted human iNPCs efficiently differentiated into neurons that displayed long-term survival, progressively acquired mature membrane properties, formed graft-host synaptic connections with mouse neurons and functionally integrated into local synaptic circuits, which eventually reinforced and repaired the neural networks of host hippocampus. Consequently, AD mice with human iNPCs exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity and improved cognitive abilities. Together, our results suggest that restoring synaptic failures by stem cells might provide new directions for the development of novel treatments for human AD.","Human Neural Stem Cells Reinforce Hippocampal Synaptic Network and Rescue Cognitive Deficits in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.

0,A panel of Transcription factors identified by data mining can predict the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Background: Transcription factors (TFs) are responsible for the regulation of various activities related to cancer like cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. It is thought that, the measurement of TFs levels could assist in developing strategies for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer detection. However, due to lack of effective genome-wide tests, this cannot be carried out in clinical settings. Methods: A complete assessment of RNA-seq data in samples of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was carried out. From the expression data of six TFs, a risk score model was developed and further validated in the GSE41613 and GSE65858 series. Potential functional roles were identified for the six TFs via gene set enrichment analysis. Results: Based on our multi-TF signature, patients are stratified into high- and low-risk groups with significant variations in overall survival (OS) (median survival 2.416 vs. 5.934 years, log-rank test P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity evaluation of our multi-TF for 3-year OS in TCGA, GSE41613 and GSE65858 was 0.707, 0.679 and 0.605, respectively, demonstrating good reproducibility and robustness for predicting overall survival of HNSCC patients. Through multivariate Cox regression analyses (MCRA) and stratified analyses, we confirmed that the predictive capability of this risk score (RS) was not dependent on any of other factors like clinicopathological parameters. Conclusions: With the help of a RS obtained from a panel of TFs expression signatures, effective OS prediction and stratification of HNSCC patients can be carried out.","A panel of Transcription factors identified by data mining can predict the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

0,Comparison of Long-term Survival Benefits in Trials of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor vs Non-Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Anticancer Agents Using ASCO Value Framework and ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale,"Importance: Recently, anticancer agents have generated excitement owing to their capacity to preserve long-term durable survival in some patients who are represented by a tail of the survival curve. However, because traditional measures of clinical benefit may not accurately capture durable survival, amendments to various valuation frameworks have been proposed to capture this benefit. Objectives: To determine how frequently immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) anticancer agents vs non-ICI anticancer agents displayed trends of long-term durable survival, as defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework version 2 (ASCO-VF v2) and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 (ESMO-MCBS v1.1), as well as to further analyze the degree of agreement between ASCO and ESMO frameworks. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, anticancer agents from phase 2 or 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) cited for clinical efficacy evidence in drug approval by the US Food and Drug Administration between January 2011 and March 2018 were identified. Data required for the ASCO-VF v2 tail-of-the-curve bonus and the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 immunotherapy-triggered long-term plateau adjustments were extracted from relevant RCTs. Frequency and difference in proportions were calculated to determine how often survival benefits were awarded to anticancer agents overall and to ICI and non-ICI anticancer agents individually. Main Outcomes and Measures: American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework v2 tail-of-the-curve bonuses and ESMO-MCBS v1.1 immunotherapy-triggered long-term plateau adjustments. Results: In total, 247 RCTs were identified, and 100 RCTs involving 57164 patients were included, with 14 examining ICI agents (1 ipilimumab, 5 pembrolizumab, 5 nivolumab, 2 atezolizumab, and 1 durvalumab) and 86 examining non-ICI agents (74 targeted therapy, 8 chemotherapy, 3 hormone therapy, and 1 radiopharmaceutical). Randomized clinical trials were awarded ASCO-VF v2 tail-of-the-curve bonuses more often than ESMO-MCBS v1.1 immunotherapy-triggered long-term plateau adjustments (ASCO-VF v2, 45.0% [8 of 14 ICI RCTs and 37 of 86 non-ICI RCTs] vs ESMO-MCBS v1.1, 2.6% [1 of 12 ICI RCTs and 1 of 66 non-ICI RCTs). Randomized clinical trials for ICIs were not more likely to receive an ASCO-VF v2 bonus or ESMO-MCBS v1.1 adjustment than non-ICI RCTs (ASCO-VF: risk difference, 0.14; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.42; P =.32; ESMO-MCBS: risk difference, 0.07; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.23; P =.40). Poor agreement was found between the framework algorithms in identifying long-term survival benefits from RCTs (Îº = 0.01; 95% CI, -0.23 to 0.22; P =.50). Conclusions and Relevance: The ASCO-VF v2 and ESMO-MCBS v1.1 may require additional refinement to accurately capture the benefit of durable long-term survival, or ICI agents may not preserve long-term survival as conventionally thought.","Comparison of Long-term Survival Benefits in Trials of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor vs Non-Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Anticancer Agents Using ASCO Value Framework and ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale. Importance: Recently, anticancer agents have generated excitement owing to their capacity to preserve long-term durable survival in some patients who are represented by a tail of the survival curve. However, because traditional measures of clinical benefit may not accurately capture durable survival, amendments to various valuation frameworks have been proposed to capture this benefit. Objectives: To determine how frequently immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) anticancer agents vs non-ICI anticancer agents displayed trends of long-term durable survival, as defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework version 2 (ASCO-VF v2) and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 (ESMO-MCBS v1.1), as well as to further analyze the degree of agreement between ASCO and ESMO frameworks. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, anticancer agents from phase 2 or 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) cited for clinical efficacy evidence in drug approval by the US Food and Drug Administration between January 2011 and March 2018 were identified. Data required for the ASCO-VF v2 tail-of-the-curve bonus and the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 immunotherapy-triggered long-term plateau adjustments were extracted from relevant RCTs. Frequency and difference in proportions were calculated to determine how often survival benefits were awarded to anticancer agents overall and to ICI and non-ICI anticancer agents individually. Main Outcomes and Measures: American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework v2 tail-of-the-curve bonuses and ESMO-MCBS v1.1 immunotherapy-triggered long-term plateau adjustments. Results: In total, 247 RCTs were identified, and 100 RCTs involving 57164 patients were included, with 14 examining ICI agents (1 ipilimumab, 5 pembrolizumab, 5 nivolumab, 2 atezolizumab, and 1 durvalumab) and 86 examining non-ICI agents (74 targeted therapy, 8 chemotherapy, 3 hormone therapy, and 1 radiopharmaceutical). Randomized clinical trials were awarded ASCO-VF v2 tail-of-the-curve bonuses more often than ESMO-MCBS v1.1 immunotherapy-triggered long-term plateau adjustments (ASCO-VF v2, 45.0% [8 of 14 ICI RCTs and 37 of 86 non-ICI RCTs] vs ESMO-MCBS v1.1, 2.6% [1 of 12 ICI RCTs and 1 of 66 non-ICI RCTs). Randomized clinical trials for ICIs were not more likely to receive an ASCO-VF v2 bonus or ESMO-MCBS v1.1 adjustment than non-ICI RCTs (ASCO-VF: risk difference, 0.14; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.42; P =.32; ESMO-MCBS: risk difference, 0.07; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.23; P =.40).

0,Efficient method for isolation of reticulocyte RNA from healthy individuals and hemolytic anaemia patients,"Despite enormous progress and development of high-throughput methods in genome-wide mRNA analyses, data on the erythroid transcriptome are still limited, even though they could be useful in medical diagnostics and personalized therapy as well as in research on normal and pathological erythroid maturation. Although obtaining normal and pathological reticulocyte transcriptome profiles should contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular bases of terminal erythroid differentiation as well as the mechanisms of the hematological diseases, a basic limitation of these studies is the difficulty of efficient reticulocyte RNA isolation from human peripheral blood. The restricted number of possible parallel experiments primarily concern healthy individuals with the lowest number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood and a low RNA content. In the present study, an efficient method for reticulocyte RNA isolation from healthy individuals and hemolytic anaemia patients is presented. The procedure includes leukofiltration, Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation, Percoll gradient centrifugation, and negative (CD45 and CD61) immunomagnetic separation. This relatively fast and simple four-stage method was successfully applied to obtain a reticulocyte-rich population from healthy subjects, which was used to efficiently isolate the high-quality RNA essential for successful NGS-based transcriptome analysis.","Efficient method for isolation of reticulocyte RNA from healthy individuals and hemolytic anaemia patients.

0,Avenanthramide A triggers potent ROS-mediated anti-tumor effects in colorectal cancer by directly targeting DDX3,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant gastrointestinal tumor with high mortality worldwide. Drug resistance and cytotoxicity to normal cells are the main causes of chemotherapeutic treatment failure in CRC. Therefore, extracting the bioactive compounds from natural products with anti-carcinogenic activity and minimal side-effects is a promising strategy against CRC. The present study aims to evaluate the anti-carcinogenic properties of avenanthramides (AVNs) extracted from oats bran and clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that AVNs treatment suppressed mitochondrial bioenergetic generation, resulting in mitochondrial swelling and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Further study indicated that AVNs treatment significantly reduced DDX3 expression, an oncogenic RNA helicase highly expressed in human CRC tissues. DDX3 overexpression reversed the ROS-mediated CRC apoptosis induced by AVNs. Of note, we identified Avenanthramide A (AVN A) as the effective ingredient in AVNs extracts. AVN A blocked the ATPase activity of DDX3 and induced its degradation by directly binding to the Arg287 and Arg294 residues in DDX3. In conclusion, these innovative findings highlight that AVNs extracts, in particular its bioactive compound AVN A may crack the current hurdles in the way of CRC treatment.","Avenanthramide A triggers potent ROS-mediated anti-tumor effects in colorectal cancer by directly targeting DDX3.

0,Flavokawain B targets protein neddylation for enhancing the anti-prostate cancer effect of Bortezomib via Skp2 degradation,"Background: Flavokawain B (FKB) has been identified from kava root extracts as a potent apoptosis inducer for inhibiting the growth of various cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer. However, the molecular targets of FKB in prostate cancer cells remain unknown. Methods: An in vitro NEDD8 Initiation Conjugation Assay was used to evaluate the neddylation inhibitory activity of FKB. Molecular docking and a cellular thermal shift assay were performed to assess the direct interaction between FKB and the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) complex. Protein neddylation, ubiqutination, stability and expression in cells were assessed with immunoprecipitation and Western blotting methods using specific antibodies. Deletion and site specific mutants and siRNAs were used to evaluate deep mechanisms by which FKB induces Skp2 degradation. Cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction were measured by MTT, ELISA and Western blotting methods. Results: FKB inhibits NEDD8 conjugations to both Cullin1 and Ubc12 in prostate cancer cell lines and Ubc12 neddylation in an in vitro assay. Molecular docking study and a cellular thermal shift assay reveal that FKB interacts with the regulatory subunit (i.e. APP-BP1) of the NAE. In addition, FKB causes Skp2 degradation in an ubiquitin and proteasome dependent manner. Overexpression of dominant-negative cullin1 (1-452), K720R mutant (the neddylation site) Cullin1 or the F-box deleted Skp2 that losses its binding to the Skp1/Cullin1 complex causes the resistance to FKB-induced Skp2 degradation, whereas siRNA knock-down of Cdh1, a known E3 ligase of Skp2 for targeted degradation, didn't attenuate the effect of FKB on Skp2 degradation. These results suggest that degradation of Skp2 by FKB is involved in a functional Cullin1. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors Bortezomib and MG132 transcriptionally down-regulate the expression of Skp2, and their combinations with FKB result in enhanced inhibitory effects on the growth of prostate cancer cell lines via synergistic down-regulation of Skp2 and up-regulation of p27/Kip1 and p21/WAF1 protein expression. FKB also selectively inhibits the growth of RB deficient cells with high expression of Skp2. Conclusion: These findings provide a rationale for further investigating combination of FKB and Bortezomib for treatment of RB deficient, castration-resistant prostate cancer.","Flavokawain B targets protein neddylation for enhancing the anti-prostate cancer effect of Bortezomib via Skp2 degradation.

0,Artificial neural network in total survival predicting of multiple myeloma patients,"Introduction At the present stage, the prediction of total survival (TS) in multiple myeloma (MM) is usually carried out by the ISS staging system (2005). In real clinical practice, the parameters can significantly differ from the expected, while some patients overcome it, and some do not reach it.The more accurate prediction of the patients TS will optimize the therapeutic tactics choice and take into account the patient`s individual characteristics. The latter reflects the personalized medicine principles, which are the basis of modern trends in therapeutic science. The aim of this work was a study of artificial neural network (ANN), in order to predict TS in patients with MM, because the ANN has the properties of a universal classifier, clusterization and can be used for regression analysis. Methods There were examined 135 patients MM I-III stage with known TS data. At the time of diagnosis, gender, age, Charlson comorbidity index were taken into account, and biochemical parameters such as total protein, albumin, ÃŸ2-microglobulin, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate by MDRD, urea, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, glucose were studied. It was necessary to develop the ANN for TS predicting on available clinical data. The ANN based on simple perceptrons was chosen for the study, implemented in the language of artificial intelligence Python. As input, the two Excel spreadsheets were used, storing the initial data on the clinical performance of patients and data on the clinical performance of patients with known TS. As an output document for the information system, an Excel spreadsheet was also used, in which, as a result of the ANN work, the prognostic value of the patientâ€™s TS was determined. The information system is implemented in the form of a doctor automated place, with the ability to transfer information to the hospital information system. Results The two modes of operation were implemented in the system: training and forecasting. In the training mode, the results of clinical data and TS were fed to the input of the neural network and neuron weights were adjusted. ANN training was conducted on all known patients (135 people) and was repeated 100 thousand times to more accurately adjust the significance of clinical parameters affecting TS. In the forecast mode, clinical data results were fed to the input of the neural network and forecasts were formed. The ANN experimental studies are showing the results with artificial neural network (Table 1). Conclusions The experiment showed more accurate TS prediction using ANN, compared to the currently adopted ISS system. In addition, the ANN provides for the study of existing relationships on ready-made models, does not require assumptions of the main distribution of the population, and is able to work with incomplete and fuzzy data. The use of intellectual information technologies opens up new opportunities in the study of dynamic problems in the field of medicine.","Artificial neural network in total survival predicting of multiple myeloma patients.

0,Gene-based analysis of ADHD using PASCAL: A biological insight into the novel associated genes,"Background: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) which may significantly impact on the affected individual's life. ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)). In addition to PASCAL analysis a gene network and an enrichment analysis for KEGG and GO terms were carried out. Moreover, GENE2FUNC tool was employed to create gene expression heatmaps and to carry out a (DEG) (Differentially Expressed Gene) analysis using GTEX v7 and BrainSpan data. Results: PASCAL results have revealed the association of new loci with ADHD and it has also highlighted other genes previously reported by MAGMA analysis. PASCAL was able to discover new associations at a gene level for ADHD: FEZF1 (p-value: 2.2 Ã— 10- 7) and FEZF1-AS1 (p-value: 4.58 Ã— 10- 7). In addition, PASCAL has been able to highlight association of other genes that share the same LD block with some previously reported ADHD susceptibility genes. Gene network analysis has revealed several interactors with the associated ADHD genes and different GO and KEGG terms have been associated. In addition, GENE2FUNC has demonstrated the existence of several up and down regulated expression clusters when the associated genes and their interactors were considered. Conclusions: PASCAL has been revealed as an efficient tool to extract additional information from previous GWAS using their summary statistics. This study has identified novel ADHD associated genes that were not previously reported when other GBA methods were employed. Moreover, a biological insight into the biological function of the ADHD associated genes across brain regions and neurodevelopmental stages is provided.","Gene-based analysis of ADHD using PASCAL: A biological insight into the novel associated genes.

However, little is known about the intrinsic structures of the HRGsâ€“MINW, mainly due to a lack of analysis tools to decipher MINWs. By introducing general hyper-geometric distribution, we obtained a statistically reliable gene set of HRGs (SR-HRGs) from several datasets. Next, MINWs were reconstructed from several independent GBM expression datasets. Algebraic topological analysis was performed to quantitatively analyze the amount of equivalence classes of cycles in various dimensions by calculating the Betti numbers. Persistent homology analysis of a filtration of growing networks was further performed to examine robust topological structures in the network by investigating the Betti curves, life length of the cycles. Random networks with the same number of node and edge and degree distribution were produced as controls. As a result, GBMâ€“HRGsâ€“MINWs reconstructed from different datasets exhibited great consistent Betti curves to each other, which were significantly different from that of random networks. Furthermore, HRGsâ€“MINWs reconstructed from normal brain expression datasets exhibited topological structures significantly different from that of GBMâ€“HRGsâ€“MINWs. Analysis of cycles in GBMâ€“HRGsâ€“MINWs revealed genes that had clinical implications, and key parts of the cycles were also identified in reconstructed proteinâ€“protein interaction networks. In addition, the cycles are composed by genes involved in the Warburg effect, immune regulation, and angiogenesis. In summary, GBMâ€“HRGsâ€“MINWs contained abundant molecular interacting cycles in different dimensions, which are composed by genes involved in multiple programs essential for the tumorigenesis of GBM, revealing novel interaction diagrams in GBM and providing novel potential therapeutic targets.","Hypoxia Regulated Gene Network in Glioblastoma Has Special Algebraic Topology Structures and Revealed Communications Involving Warburg Effect and Immune Regulation.

Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to finding a medicine to repair these fractures. Amongst the most mysterious herbs, Aloe vera stands out. In the present study, the ameliorating function of A. vera on osteogenesis was studied in vitro and in vivo. Osteoblast-like cells were exposed to A. vera, followed by analysis of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The results showed an enhanced cell biocompatibility in a dose-dependent manner due to attenuated intracellular ROS production. Furthermore, a docking study indicated that the strong affinity of A. vera constituents to type I bone morphogenic protein receptor (BMPR1A) without the involvement of the BMPR1A chain B. The induction of osteogenesis prompts extracellular calcium deposition by osteoblasts, which affirms successful in vitro bone regeneration. However, injection of A. vera in rats with critical size calvarial defects induced Runx2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), OCN, and BMP2 genes overexpression, which led to the formation of victorious bone with enhanced bone density and ALP activity. It is worthy to note that Aloin has the highest affinity to BMPR1A, whereas there are no reports regarding the impact of Aloenin, Aloesin, and Î³-sitosterol on osteogenesis. Furthermore, some of them have antitumor potency, and it might be proposed that they are considered as a bone substitute in the osteotomy site of osteosarcoma with the aim of bone recovery and suppression of osteosarcoma.

Although it is well established that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, we lack a full view of the diversity of metabolic programs in cancer cells and an unbiased assessment of the associations between metabolic pathway preferences and other cell-autonomous processes. Here, we quantified metabolic features, mostly from the 13C enrichment of molecules from central carbon metabolism, in over 80 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines cultured under identical conditions. Because these cell lines were extensively annotated for oncogenotype, gene expression, protein expression, and therapeutic sensitivity, the resulting database enables the user to uncover new relationships between metabolism and these orthogonal processes. Metabolic reprogramming influences therapeutic sensitivity in cancer, but the scope of metabolic diversity among cancer cells is unknown. Chen et al. characterized metabolic phenotypes in over 80 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and then used genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and therapeutic sensitivities to uncover relationships between metabolism and orthogonal processes.","Metabolic Diversity in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.

Here, we sought to determine the characteristic cellular and cytokine polarization profile in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of neural network-based representation learning algorithms, we identified an expanded T helper cell subset in patients with MS, characterized by the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4. This cellular signature, which includes expression of very late antigen 4 in peripheral blood, was also enriched in the central nervous system of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Lastly, we also found the population to be reduced under effective disease-modifying therapy, suggesting that the identified T cell profile represents a specific therapeutic target in MS.","GM-CSF and CXCR4 define a T helper cell signature in multiple sclerosis. Cytokine dysregulation is a central driver of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we sought to determine the characteristic cellular and cytokine polarization profile in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF).

0,Functional mimetic peptide discovery isolated by phage display interacts selectively to fibronectin domain and inhibits gelatinase,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play critical roles in a multiple number of autoimmunity diseases progression and metastasis of solid tumor. Gelatinases including MMP-2 and MMP-9 are extremely overexpressed in multiple pathological processes. MMP-9 and MMP-2 breakdown the extracellular matrix component gelatin very efficaciously. Therefore, designing and expansion of MMPs inhibitors can be an engrossing plan for therapeutic intermediacy. Anyway, a wide range of MMPs inhibitors face failure in several clinical trials. Due to sequence and structural conservation across the various MMPs, achieving specific and selective inhibitors is very demanding. In the current study, a phage-displayed peptide library was screened using active human recombinant MMP-9 protein and evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Here, we isolate novel peptide sequence from phage display peptide libraries that can be a specific gelatinase inhibitor. Interestingly, in silico molecular docking showed strong interactions between the peptide three-dimensional models and some important residues of the MMP-9 and MMP-2 proteins at the fibronectin domain. A consensus peptide sequence was then synthesized (named as RSH-12) to evaluate its inhibitory potency by in vitro assays. Zymography assay was employed to evaluate the effect of RSH-12 on gelatinolysis activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion from the HT1080 cells using different concentrations of RSH-12 and inhibiting MMP-9- and MMP-2-driven gelatin proteolysis, measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-gelatin degradation assay and HT1080 cellÂ invasion assay on Matrigel (gelatinous protein mixture). The negative control peptide (CP) with the irrelevant sequence and no MMP inhibition properties and the positive control compound (GM6001) as a potent inhibitor of MMPs were used to assess the selectivity and specificity of gelatinases inhibition by RSH-12. Therefore, RSH-12 decreased the gelatin degradation by specifically preventing gelatin binding to MMP-9 and MMP-2. Selective gelatinase inhibitors may prove the usefulness of the new peptide discovered in tumor targeting and anticancer and anti-inflammation therapies.","Functional mimetic peptide discovery isolated by phage display interacts selectively to fibronectin domain and inhibits gelatinase.

The only available therapeutic options for calcific vascular and valvular heart disease are invasive transcatheter procedures or surgeries that do not fully address the wide spectrum of these conditions; therefore, an urgent need exists for medical options. Cardiovascular calcification is an active process, which provides a potential opportunity for effective therapeutic targeting. Numerous biological processes are involved in calcific disease, including matrix remodelling, transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, calcium and phosphate signalling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid and mineral metabolism, autophagy, inflammation, apoptosis, loss of mineralization inhibition, impaired mineral resorption, cellular senescence and extracellular vesicles that act as precursors of microcalcification. Advances in molecular imaging and big data technology, including in multiomics and network medicine, and the integration of these approaches are helping to provide a more comprehensive map of human disease. In this Review, we discuss ectopic calcification processes in the cardiovascular system, with an emphasis on emerging mechanistic knowledge obtained through patient data and advances in imaging methods, experimental models and multiomics-generated big data. We also highlight the potential and challenges of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning to integrate imaging and mechanistic data for drug discovery.","Cardiovascular calcification: artificial intelligence and big data accelerate mechanistic discovery.

Here we report a method that gives information on the isomeric variants of glycans in a format compatible with analyzing low-abundance proteins. Onchip glycan modification and probing (on-chip gmap) uses sequential and parallel rounds of exoglycosidase cleavage and lectin profiling of microspots of proteins, together with algorithms that incorporate glycan-array analyses and information from mass spectrometry, when available, to computationally interpret the data. In tests on control proteins with simple or complex glycosylation, on-chip gmap accurately characterized the relative proportions of core types and terminal features of glycans. Subterminal features (monosaccharides and linkages under a terminal monosaccharide) were accurately probed using a rationally designed sequence of lectin and exoglycosidase incubations. The integration of mass information further improved accuracy in each case. An alternative use of on-chip gmap was to complement the mass spectrometry analysis of detached glycans by specifying the isomers that comprise the glycans identified by mass spectrometry. On-chip gmap provides the potential for detailed studies of glycosylation in a format compatible with clinical specimens or other low-abundance sources.","Deciphering protein glycosylation by computational integration of on-chip profiling, glycan-array data, and mass spectrometry.

0,Identification of biomarkers correlated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with co-expression analysis,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is reported to be the most common genetic heart disease. To identify key module and candidate biomarkers correlated with clinical prognosis of patients with HCM, we carried out this study with co-expression analysis. To construct a co-expression network of hub genes correlated with HCM, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was performed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The protein-protein interaction network analysis of central genes was performed to recognize the interactions of central genes. Gene set enrichment analyses were carried out to discover the possible mechanisms involved in the pathways promoted by hub genes. To validate the hub genes, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed. Based on the results of topological overlap measure based clustering, 2,351 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Those genes were included in six different modules. Of these modules, the yellow and the blue modules showed a pivotal correlation with HCM. DEGs were enriched in immune system procedure associated GO terms and KEGG pathways. We identified nine hub genes (TYROBP, STAT3, CSF1R, ITGAM, SYK, ITGB2, LILRB2, LYN, and HCK) affected the immune system significantly. Among the genes we validated with RT-PCR, TYROBP, CSF1R, and SYK showed significant increasing expression levels in model HCM rats. In conclusion, we identified two modules and nine hub genes, which were prominently associated with HCM. We found that immune system may play a crucial role in the HCM. Accordingly, those genes and pathways might become therapeutic targets with clinical usefulness in the future.","Identification of biomarkers correlated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with co-expression analysis.

Multiple cyclins are involved, but the global role of cyclin-specific phosphorylation has remained unsolved. We uncovered a cyclin docking motif, LxF, that mediates binding of replication factor Cdc6 to mitotic cyclin. This interaction leads to phospho-adaptor Cks1-mediated inhibition of M-CDK to facilitate Cdc6 accumulation and sequestration in mitosis. The LxF motif and Cks1 also mediate the mutual inhibition between M-CDK and the tyrosine kinase Swe1. Additionally, the LxF motif is critical for targeting M-CDK to phosphorylate several mitotic regulators; for example, Spo12 is targeted via LxF to release the phosphatase Cdc14. The results complete the full set of G1, S, and M-CDK docking mechanisms and outline the unified role of cyclin specificity and CDK activity thresholds. Cooperation of cyclin and Cks1 docking creates a variety of CDK thresholds and switching orders, including combinations of last in, first out (LIFO) and first in, first out (FIFO) ordering. Ã–rd et al. find that a short linear motif in proteins enables specific targeting by the mitotic CDK. Depending on the context, this motif can lead to either enhanced phosphorylation of mitotic targets or inhibition of the CDK complex in cooperation with the phospho-adaptor subunit Cks1.","Cyclin-Specific Docking Mechanisms Reveal the Complexity of M-CDK Function in the Cell Cycle.

0,Spread of alpha-synuclein pathology through the brain connectome is modulated by selective vulnerability and predicted by network analysis,"Studies of patients afflicted by neurodegenerative diseases suggest that misfolded proteins spread through the brain along anatomically connected networks, prompting progressive decline. Recently, mouse models have recapitulated the cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic proteins and neuron death observed in patients. However, the factors regulating the spread of pathogenic proteins remain a matter of debate due to an incomplete understanding of how vulnerability functions in the context of spread. Here we use quantitative pathology mapping in the mouse brain, combined with network modeling to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of spread. Patterns of alpha-synuclein pathology are well described by a network model that is based on two factors: anatomical connectivity and endogenous alpha-synuclein expression. The map and model allow the assessment of selective vulnerability to alpha-synuclein pathology development and neuron death. Finally, we use quantitative pathology to understand how the G2019S LRRK2 genetic risk factor affects the spread and toxicity of alpha-synuclein pathology.","Spread of alpha-synuclein pathology through the brain connectome is modulated by selective vulnerability and predicted by network analysis.

Here, we measure region-specific NSC gene expression along the rostrocaudal axis in a human pluripotent stem cell model of early central nervous system development over a 72-h time course, spanning the hindbrain to cervical spinal cord. We introduce Escarole, a probabilistic clustering algorithm for non-stationary time series, and combine it with prior-based regulatory network inference to identify genes that are regulated dynamically and predict their upstream regulators. We identify known regulators of patterning and neural development, including the HOX genes, and predict a direct regulatory connection between the transcription factor POU3F2 and target gene STMN2. We demonstrate that POU3F2 is required for expression of STMN2, suggesting that this regulatory connection is important for region specificity of NSCs.","Inferring Regulatory Programs Governing Region Specificity of Neuroepithelial Stem Cells during Early Hindbrain and Spinal Cord Development.

0,Clinical and Genomic Risk to Guide the Use of Adjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer may be guided by clinicopathological factors and a score based on a 21-gene assay to determine the risk of recurrence. Whether the level of clinical risk of breast cancer recurrence adds prognostic information to the recurrence score is not known. METHODS: We performed a prospective trial involving 9427 women with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer, in whom an assay of 21 genes had been performed, and we classified the clinical risk of recurrence of breast cancer as low or high on the basis of the tumor size and histologic grade. The effect of clinical risk was evaluated by calculating hazard ratios for distant recurrence with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. The initial endocrine therapy was tamoxifen alone in the majority of the premenopausal women who were 50 years of age or younger. RESULTS: The level of clinical risk was prognostic of distant recurrence in women with an intermediate 21-gene recurrence score of 11 to 25 (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis or a greater potential benefit from chemotherapy) who were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy (hazard ratio for the comparison of high vs. low clinical risk, 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93 to 3.87) or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.66 to 3.48) and in women with a high recurrence score (a score of 26 to 100), all of whom were assigned to chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.19). Among women who were 50 years of age or younger who had received endocrine therapy alone, the estimated (+/-SE) rate of distant recurrence at 9 years was less than 5% (</=1.8+/-0.9%) with a low recurrence score (a score of 0 to 10), irrespective of clinical risk, and 4.7+/-1.0% with an intermediate recurrence score and low clinical risk. In this age group, the estimated distant recurrence at 9 years exceeded 10% among women with a high clinical risk and an intermediate recurrence score who received endocrine therapy alone (12.3+/-2.4%) and among those with a high recurrence score who received chemoendocrine therapy (15.2+/-3.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical-risk stratification provided prognostic information that, when added to the 21-gene recurrence score, could be used to identify premenopausal women who could benefit from more effective therapy.

In the early 1990s, the first equipment for image cytometry (laser scanning cytometry, LSC) became commercially available. As flow cytometry was considered the gold standard, various studies found that the results of flow cytometry and LSC generated comparable results.

One of the newer programs for image analysis that is not limited to fluorescence images is the free software CellProfiler. In 2008, the same group published a new software, CellProfiler Analyst. One part of CellProfiler Analyst is a supervised machine-learning-based classifier that allows users to conduct imaging-based diagnoses, e.g., cellular diagnosis based on morphology. Another relatively new, free software for image analysis is QuPath. The aim of the present study was to compare two free programs for conducting image analysis, CellProfiler and QuPath, and the subsequent classification based on machine learning. For this study, images of renal tissue were analyzed, and the identified objects were classified. The same images were loaded in both software programs. Advanced statistical analysis was used to compare the two methods. The Bland-Altman assay showed that all of the differences were within the mean Â± 1.96 * standard deviation, i.e., the differences are normally distributed, and the software programs are comparable. For the analyzed samples (renal tissue stained with HIF and TUNEL), the use of QuPath was easier because it offers image analysis without a previous processing of the images (e.g., conversion to grayscale, inverted intensities) and an unsupervised machine learning process.","Comparison between two programs for image analysis, machine learning and subsequent classification.

0,S100P is a molecular determinant of E-cadherin function in gastric cancer,"Background: E-cadherin has been awarded a key role in the aetiology of both sporadic and hereditary forms of gastric cancer. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular interactors that influence the expression and function of E-cadherin associated to cancer. Methods: A data mining approach was used to predict stomach-specific candidate genes, uncovering S100P as a key candidate. The role of S100P was evaluated through in vitro functional assays and its expression was studied in a gastric cancer tissue microarray (TMA). Results: S100P was found to contribute to a cancer pathway dependent on the context of E-cadherin function. In particular, we demonstrated that S100P acts as an E-cadherin positive regulator in a wild-type E-cadherin context, and its inhibition results in decreased E-cadherin expression and function. In contrast, S100P is likely to be a pro-survival factor in gastric cancer cells with loss of functional E-cadherin, contributing to an oncogenic molecular program. Moreover, expression analysis in a gastric cancer TMA revealed that S100P expression impacts negatively among patients bearing Ecad- tumours, despite not being significantly associated with overall survival on its own. Conclusions: We propose that S100P has a dual role in gastric cancer, acting as an oncogenic factor in the context of E-cadherin loss and as a tumour suppressor in a functional E-cadherin setting. The discovery of antagonist effects of S100P in different E-cadherin contexts will aid in the stratification of gastric cancer patients who may benefit from S100P-targeted therapies.

0,A randomized controlled trial of suicide prevention training for primary care providers: a study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a national public health crisis and a critical patient safety issue. It is the 10th leading cause of death overall and the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults (15-34â€‰years old). Research shows 80% of youth who died by suicide saw their primary care provider within the year of their death. It is imperative that primary care providers develop the knowledge and skills to talk with patients about distress and suicidal thoughts, and to assess and respond in the context of the ongoing patient - primary care provider relationship. METHODS: This study examines the effectiveness of simulation on suicide prevention training for providers-in-training by comparing two conditions: 1) a control group that receives online teaching on suicide prevention in primary care via brief online videos and 2) an experimental group that includes the same online teaching videos plus two standardized patient (SP) interactions (face-to-face and telehealth, presentation randomized). All SP interactions are video-recorded. The primary analysis is a comparison of the two groups' suicide prevention skills using an SP ""test case"" at 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: The primary research question examines the impact of practice (through SP simulation) over and above online teaching alone on suicide prevention skills demonstrated at follow-up. We will assess moderators of outcomes, differences among SP simulations (i.e., face-to-face vs. telehealth modalities), and whether the experimental group's suicide prevention skills improve over the three SP experiences.

0,Evaluating the role of RAD52 and its interactors as novel potential molecular targets for hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background: Radiation sensitive 52 (RAD52) is an important protein that mediates DNA repair in tumors. However, little is known about the impact of RAD52 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the expression of RAD52 and its values in HCC. Some proteins that might be coordinated with RAD52 in HCC were also analyzed. Methods: Global RAD52 mRNA levels in HCC were assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. RAD52 expression was analyzed in 70 HCC tissues and adjacent tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of over-expressed RAD52 in Huh7 HCC cells was investigated. The String database was then used to perform enrichment and functional analysis of RAD52 and its interactome. Cytoscape software was used to create a protein-protein interaction network. Molecular interaction studies with RAD52 and its interactome were performed using the molecular docking tools in Hex8.0.0. Finally, these DNA repair proteins, which interact with RAD52, were also analyzed using the TCGA dataset and were detected by qRT-PCR. Based on the TCGA database, algorithms combining ROC between RAD52 and RAD52 interactors were used to diagnose HCC by binary logistic regression. Results: In TCGA, upregulated RAD52 related to gender was obtained in HCC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of RAD52 was 0.704. The results of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) indicated no difference in the prognosis between patients with high and low RAD52 gene expression. We validated that RAD52 expression was increased at the mRNA and protein levels in Chinese HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Higher RAD52 was associated with older age, without correlation with other clinicopathological factors. In vitro, over-expressed RAD52 significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of Huh7 cells. Furthermore, RAD52 interactors (radiation sensitive 51, RAD51; X-ray repair cross complementing 6, XRCC6; Cofilin, CFL1) were also increased in HCC and participated in some biological processes with RAD52. Protein structure analysis showed that RAD52-RAD51 had the firmest binding structure with the lowest E-total energy (- 1120.5 kcal/mol) among the RAD52-RAD51, RAD52-CFL1, and RAD52-XRCC6 complexes. An algorithm combining ROC between RAD52 and its interactome indicated a greater specificity and sensitivity for HCC screening. Conclusions: Overall, our study suggested that RAD52 plays a vital role in HCC pathogenesis and serves as a potential molecular target for HCC diagnosis and treatment. This study's findings regarding the multigene prediction and diagnosis of HCC are valuable.","Evaluating the role of RAD52 and its interactors as novel potential molecular targets for hepatocellular carcinoma.

0,Cognitive refractory state caused by spontaneous epileptic high-frequency oscillations in the human brain,"Epileptic brain tissue is often considered physiologically dysfunctional, and the optimal treatment of many patients with uncontrollable seizures involves surgical removal of the epileptic tissue. However, it is unclear to what extent the epileptic tissue is capable of generating physiological responses to cognitive stimuli and how cognitive deficits ensuing surgical resections can be determined using state-of-the-art computational methods. To address these unknowns, we recruited six patients with nonlesional epilepsies and identified the epileptic focus in each patient with intracranial electrophysiological monitoring. We measured spontaneous epileptic activity in the form of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded stimulus-locked physiological responses in the form of physiological high-frequency broadband activity, and explored the interaction of the two as well as their behavioral correlates. Across all patients, we found abundant normal physiological responses to relevant cognitive stimuli in the epileptic sites. However, these physiological responses were more likely to be ""seized"" (delayed or missed) when spontaneous HFOs occurred about 850 to 1050 ms before, until about 150 to 250 ms after, the onset of relevant cognitive stimuli. Furthermore, spontaneous HFOs in medial temporal lobe affected the subjects' memory performance. Our findings suggest that nonlesional epileptic sites are capable of generating normal physiological responses and highlight a compelling mechanism for cognitive deficits in these patients. The results also offer clinicians a quantitative tool to differentiate pathological and physiological high-frequency activities in epileptic sites and to indirectly assess their possible cognitive reserve function and approximate the risk of resective surgery.","Cognitive refractory state caused by spontaneous epileptic high-frequency oscillations in the human brain.

Inactivation of the NOTCH signaling pathway was uncovered to be correlated with the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer (BCa). Nevertheless, the specific molecular mechanism of NOTCH1 (one of the core factors of the NOTCH signaling pathway) is not well elucidated in BCa. This study focused on the mechanism by which NOTCH1 affects the biological behaviors of BCa cells. According to the experimental results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, NOTCH1 was dysregulated in BCa tissues and cell lines. The prognostic value of NOTCH1 for the patients with BCa was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mechanism investigations revealed that NOTCH1 is a target of miR-34c-5p in BCa. Furthermore, microarray analysis was used to find the dysregulatedÂ long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), which can bind with miR-34c-5p. Mechanism experiments further demonstrated the rationality of the HCG18-miR-34c-5p-NOTCH1 pathway. Functional assays were then applied to validate the inhibitory influences of NOTCH1 on the proliferation and migration of BCa cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of NOTCH1 could be affected by miR-34c-5p or lncRNA HCG18. All findings in this study revealed that NOTCH1 suppresses the BCa progression by cooperating with lncRNA HCG18 and miR-34c-5p.","NOTCH1 regulates the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells by cooperating with long non-coding RNA HCG18 and microRNA-34c-5p.

0,NNAlign-MA; MHC peptidome deconvolution for accurate MHC binding motif characterization and improved t-cell epitope predictions,"The set of peptides presented on a cell's surface by MHC molecules is known as the immunopeptidome. Current mass spectrometry technologies allow for identification of large peptidomes, and studies have proven these data to be a rich source of information for learning the rules of MHC-mediated antigen presentation. Immunopeptidomes are usually poly-specific, containing multiple sequence motifs matching the MHC molecules expressed in the system under investigation. Motif deconvolution -the process of associating each ligand to its presenting MHC molecule(s)- is therefore a critical and challenging step in the analysis of MS-eluted MHC ligand data. Here, we describe NNAlign-MA, a computational method designed to address this challenge and fully benefit from large, poly-specific data sets of MS-eluted ligands. NNAlign-MA simultaneously performs the tasks of (1) clustering peptides into individual specificities; (2) automatic annotation of each cluster to an MHC molecule; and (3) training of a prediction model covering all MHCs present in the training set. NNAlign-MA was benchmarked on large and diverse data sets, covering class I and class II data. In all cases, the method was demonstrated to outperform state-ofthe- art methods, effectively expanding the coverage of alleles for which accurate predictions can be made, resulting in improved identification of both eluted ligands and T-cell epitopes. Given its high flexibility and ease of use, we expect NNAlign-MA to serve as an effective tool to increase our understanding of the rules of MHC antigen presentation and guide the development of novel T-cellbased therapeutics.","NNAlign-MA; MHC peptidome deconvolution for accurate MHC binding motif characterization and improved t-cell epitope predictions.

Although the study of HCC has made great progress, the molecular mechanism and signal pathways of HCC are not yet clear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the early diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for HCC. The aim of this study is to screen the relevant genes and study the association of gene expression with the survival status of HCC patients using bioinformatics approaches, in the hope of establishing marker genes for diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. The gene expression data and corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were downloaded from the The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We performed to study the relationship between gene expression and prognosis of HCC and screen significantly relevant genes associated with prognosis of HCC by analyzing survival and function enrichment of genes. In this study, we collected 421 samples with gene expression data, including 371 tumor samples and 50 normal samples. By using single factor Cox regression analysis, we screened 1,197 genes significantly associated with survival time in the modeling data containing 117 samples and also searched six genes as the best markers to predict living status of HCC patients. Besides, we established score system of survival risk of HCC. Our study recognized six genes (PGBD3, PGM5P3-AS1, RNF5, UTP11, BAG6, and KCND2) to be significantly associated with diagnosis and prognosis of HCC, providing novel targets for studying potential mechanism about the progression of HCC.","Six genes as potential diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma through data mining.

Phloretin (PH) possesses anticancer, antitumor, and hepatoprotective effects, however, the effects and potential mechanisms of phloretin remain elusive. Methods: Five HCC cells were tested in vitro for sensitivity to PH, Sorafenib (Sor) or both and the apoptosis, signal transduction and phosphatase activity were analyzed. To validate the role of SHP-1, we used PTP inhibitor III and SHP-1 siRNA. Further, we used purified SHP-1 proteins or HCC cells expressing deletion N-SH2 domain or D61A point mutants to study the PH efficacy on SHP-1. The 'in vivo studies were conducted using HepG2 and SK-Hep1 and Sor resistant HepG2SR and Huh7SR xenografts. Molecular docking was done with Swiss dock and Auto Dock Vina. Results: PH inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in all HCC cells by upregulating SHP-1 expression and downregulating STAT3 expression and further inhibited pAKT/pERK signaling. PH activated SHP-1 by disruption of autoinhibition of SHP-1, leading to reduced p-STAT3Tyr705 level. PH induced apoptosis in two Sor-resistant cell lines and overcome STAT3, AKT, MAPK and VEGFR2 dependent Sor resistance in HCCs. PH potently inhibited tumor growth in both Sor-sensitive and Sor-resistant xenografts in vivo by impairing angiogenesis, cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis via targeting the SHP-1/STAT3 signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our data suggest that PH inhibits STAT3 activity in Sor-sensitive and -resistant HCCs via SHP-1-mediated inhibition of STAT3 and AKT/mTOR/JAK2/VEGFR2 pathway. Our results clearly indicate that PH may be a potent reagent for hepatocellular carcinoma and a noveltargeted therapy for further clinical investigations.

We hypothesized that DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) preferentially occupy DNA with specific structures (â€œshape motifsâ€) regardless of whether or not these correspond to high information content sequence motifs. We present ShapeMF, a Gibbs sampling algorithm that identifies de novo shape motifs. Using binding data from hundreds of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that most DBPs have shape motifs and can occupy these in the absence of sequence motifs. This â€œshape-only bindingâ€ is common for many DBPs and in regions co-bound by multiple DBPs. When shape and sequence motifs co-occur, they can be overlapping, flanking, or separated by consistent spacing. Finally, DBPs within the same protein family have different shape motifs, explaining their distinct genome-wide occupancy despite having similar sequence motifs. These results suggest that shape motifs not only complement sequence motifs but also facilitate recognition of DNA beyond conventionally defined sequence motifs.","A De Novo Shape Motif Discovery Algorithm Reveals Preferences of Transcription Factors for DNA Shape Beyond Sequence Motifs.

0,Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT,"Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Methods: Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Results: We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, Ï‡ 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, Ï‡ 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusions: The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.","Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT.

Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, Ï‡ 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusions: The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power."

JAKs and IKKs are the key regulators in the STAT3 and NF-ÎºB signalling respectively. Therefore, the two families of kinases have been the major targets for developing drugs to regulate the two signalling pathways. Here, we report a natural compound xanthatin from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Xanthium L. as a potent inhibitor of both STAT3 and NF-ÎºB signalling pathways. Our data demonstrated that xanthatin was a covalent inhibitor and its activities depended on its Î±-methylene-Î³-butyrolactone group. It preferentially interacted with the Cys243 of JAK2 and the Cys412 and Cys464 of IKKÎ² to inactivate their activities. In doing so, xanthatin preferentially inhibited the growth of cancer cell lines that have constitutively activated STAT3 and p65. These data suggest that xanthatin may be a promising anticancer and anti-inflammation drug candidate.","Xanthatin inhibits STAT3 and NF-ÎºB signalling by covalently binding to JAK and IKK kinases.

0,Oxidized Low-density Lipoprotein and the Incidence of Age-related Macular Degeneration,"Purpose: To examine the relationship between serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) cholesterol and the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over a 25-year period in a sample of persons from the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES). Design: Observational prospective cohort study. Participants: A total of 4972 people from the BDES (aged 43â€“84 years and living in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin in 1988) seen during at least 1 of 6 examination phases at approximately 5-year intervals between 1988 and 2016. Methods: A 50% random sample of participants (N = 2468) was selected for ox-LDL measurements. Stored frozen specimens from every examination phase were processed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from a single batch. All available intervals were included for a person, resulting in 6586 person-visits. Main Outcome Measures: Age-related macular degeneration was assessed using the Wisconsin Age-related Maculopathy Grading System, and severity was defined using a 5-step severity scale. The severity of the worse eye at each examination was used for analyses. A multi-state Markov (MSM) model was fit to simultaneously assess the ox-LDL relationship to all AMD transitions, including incidence of any AMD, incidence of late AMD, and worsening and improvement of AMD over the 25 years of the study. Results: The mean (standard deviation) level of ox-LDL was 75.3 (23.1) U/L at the baseline examination. When adjusting for age, sex, ARMS2 and CFH risk alleles, and examination phase, the ox-LDL at the beginning of a period was not statistically significantly associated with the incidence of any AMD (hazard ratio per 10 U/L ox-LDL was 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.98,1.09). Furthermore, ox-LDL was not associated with worsening anywhere along the AMD severity scale, nor with incidence of late AMD. The lack of relationships of ox-LDL to the incidence of any AMD or worsening of AMD remained after adjustment for history of statin use, smoking status, body mass index, and history of cardiovascular disease (data not shown). Conclusions: Our findings do not provide evidence for statistically significant relationships between ox-LDL and AMD disease development or worsening of AMD.","Oxidized Low-density Lipoprotein and the Incidence of Age-related Macular Degeneration.

0,Yield and Efficiency of Novel Intensified Tuberculosis Case-Finding Algorithms for People Living with HIV,"RATIONALE: The recommended tuberculosis (TB) intensified case finding (ICF) algorithm for people living with HIV (symptom-based screening followed by Xpert MTB/RIF [Xpert] testing) is insufficiently sensitive and results in unnecessary Xpert testing. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether novel ICF algorithms combining C-reactive protein (CRP)-based screening with urine Determine TB-LAM (TB-LAM), sputum Xpert, and/or sputum culture could improve ICF yield and efficiency. METHODS: We compared the yield and efficiency of novel ICF algorithms inclusive of point-of-care CRP-based TB screening and confirmatory testing with urine TB-LAM (if CD4 count </=100 cells/mul), sputum Xpert, and/or a single sputum culture among consecutive people living with HIV with CD4 counts less than or equal to 350 cells/mul initiating antiretroviral therapy in Uganda. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,245 people living with HIV, 203 (16%) had culture-confirmed TB including 101 (49%) patients with CD4 counts less than or equal to 100 cells/mul. Compared with the current ICF algorithm, point-of-care CRP-based TB screening followed by Xpert testing had similar yield (56% [95% confidence interval, 49-63] vs. 59% [95% confidence interval, 51-65]) but consumed less than half as many Xpert assays per TB case detected (9 vs. 4). Addition of TB-LAM did not significantly increase diagnostic yield relative to the current ICF algorithm but provided same-day diagnosis for 26% of TB patients with advanced HIV. Addition of a single culture to TB-LAM and Xpert substantially improved ICF yield, identifying 78% of all TB cases. CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care CRP-based screening can improve ICF efficiency among people living with HIV. Addition of TB-LAM and a single culture to Xpert confirmatory testing could enable HIV programs to increase the speed of TB diagnosis and ICF yield.","Yield and Efficiency of Novel Intensified Tuberculosis Case-Finding Algorithms for People Living with HIV.

0,Exploring the effect of inhibitor AKB-9778 on VE-PTP by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation,"Diabetic macular edema, also known as diabetic eye disease, is mainly caused by the overexpression of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) at hypoxia/ischemic. AKB-9778 is a known VE-PTP inhibitor that can effectively interact with the active site of VE-PTP to inhibit the activity of VE-PTP. However, the binding pattern of VE-PTP with AKB-9778 and the dynamic implications of AKB-9778 on VE-PTP system at the molecular level are poorly understood. Through molecular docking, it was found that the AKB-9778 was docked well in the binding pocket of VE-PTP by the interactions of hydrogen bond and Van der Waals. Furthermore, after molecular dynamic simulations on VE-PTP system and VE-PTP AKB-9778 system, a series of postdynamic analyses found that the flexibility and conformation of the active site undergone an obvious transition after VE-PTP binding with AKB-9778. Moreover, by constructing the RIN, it was found that the different interactions in the active site were the detailed reasons for the conformational differences between these two systems. Thus, the finding here might provide a deeper understanding of AKB-9778 as VE-PTP Inhibitor.","Exploring the effect of inhibitor AKB-9778 on VE-PTP by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.

0,Identification of key lncRNAs in the carcinogenesis and progression of colon adenocarcinoma by co-expression network analysis,"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common cancers, and its carcinogenesis and progression is influenced by multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), especially through the miRNA sponge effect. In this study, more than 4000 lncRNAs were re-annotated from the microarray datasets through probe sequence mapping to obtain reliable lncRNA expression profiles. As a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify lncRNA modules associated with the five stepwise stages from normal colonic samples to COAD (n = 94). In the most relevant module (R2 = âˆ’0.78, P = 4E-20), four hub lncRNAs were identified (CTD-2396E7.11, PCGF5, RP11-33O4.1, and RP11-164P12.5). Then, these four hub lncRNAs were validated using two other independent datasets including GSE20916 (n = 145) and GSE39582 (n = 552). The results indicated that all hub lncRNAs were significantly negatively correlated with the three-stage colonic carcinogenesis, as well as TNM stages in COAD (one-way analysis of variance P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients with higher expression of each hub lncRNA had a significantly higher overall survival rate and lower relapse risk (log-rank P < 0.05). In conclusion, through co-expression analysis, we identified and validated four key lncRNAs in association with the carcinogenesis and progression of COAD, and these lncRNAs might have important clinical implications for improving the risk stratification, therapeutic decision and prognosis prediction in COAD patients.","Identification of key lncRNAs in the carcinogenesis and progression of colon adenocarcinoma by co-expression network analysis.

Methods: Radiomics features were extracted from segmented lesions of T2-FLAIR MRI data of 137 GBM patients. Radiomics features include intensity, shape and textural features in seven classes were included in the analysis. Patients were divided into two groups depending on their survival time (shorter or longer than 1-year survival). Four different machine learning algorithms were implemented to construct the prediction models. Features with top importance (importance >0.04) were selected to construct the prediction model using the model with the best performance. The interactions between image features and genomics were then analysed with Pearson's correlation analysis. Results: The GBDT model with 72 features with highest importance had the highest accuracy of 0.81 on both short and long survival time classes, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) of the short and long survival time class were 0.79 and 0.81. Six metagenes showed significant interactive effect (PÂ <Â 0.05), and Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that three of these metagenes (TIMP1, ROS1 EREG) showed moderate (0.3Â <Â |r|Â <Â 0.5) or high correlation (|r|Â >Â 0.5) with image features. Conclusion: Radiogenomics analysis shows that MRI features are predictive of survival outcomes, and image features are highly associated with selective metagenes. Radiogenomics analysis is a useful method for optimizing clinical diagnosis and selecting effective treatments.","Machine-learning based radiogenomics analysis of MRI features and metagenes in glioblastoma multiforme patients with different survival time.

METHODS: We aimed to assess the degree to which individuals would be willing to contribute their health data to such a repository. A compact e-survey probed willingness to share demographic and clinical data categories. Participants were faculty, staff, and students in two geographically diverse major medical centers (Utah and New York). Such a sample could be expected to respond like a typical potential participant from the general public who is given complete and fully informed consent about the pros and cons of participating in a research study. RESULTS: 2140 respondents completed the surveys. 56% of respondents were ""somewhat/definitely willing"" to share clinical data with identifiers, while 89% of respondents were ""somewhat (17%) /definitely willing (72%)"" to share without identifiers. Results were consistent across gender, age, and education, but there were some differences by geographical region. Individuals were most reluctant (50-74%) sharing mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence data. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a substantial fraction of potential patient participants, once educated about risks and benefits, would be willing to donate de-identified clinical data to a shared research repository. A slight majority even would be willing to share absent de-identification, suggesting that perceptions about data misuse are not a major concern. Such a repository of clinical notes should be invaluable for clinical NLP research and advancement.","Parsing clinical text using the state-of-the-art deep learning based parsers: a systematic comparison.

Of the 143 genes tested (21% of the bacterium's annotated proteins), only 55% showed an altered phenotype, highlighting the robustness of biological systems. We identified nine transcription factors (TFs) and their targets, representing 43% of the genome, and 16 regulators that indirectly affect transcription. Only 20% of transcriptional regulation is mediated by canonical TFs when responding to perturbations. Using a Random Forest, we quantified the non-redundant contribution of different mechanisms such as supercoiling, metabolic control, RNA degradation, and chromosome topology to transcriptional changes. Model-predicted gene changes correlate well with experimental data in 95% of the tested perturbations, explaining up to 70% of the total variance when also considering noise. This analysis highlights the importance of considering non-TF-mediated regulation when engineering bacteria. We have achieved a comprehensive reconstruction of a gene regulatory network in a genome-reduced bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. With this network, we observed that a large part of transcription regulation is determined by non-canonical factors such as DNA supercoiling, riboswitches, and genome organization or RNA-mediated regulation.

0,Molecular modeling and inhibitor docking analysis of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform one,"Na+/H+ exchanger isoform one (NHE1) is a mammalian plasma membrane protein that removes intracellular protons, thereby elevating intracellular pH (pHi). NHE1 uses the energy of allowing an extracellular sodium down its gradient into cells to remove one intracellular proton. The ubiquitous protein has several important physiological and pathological influences on mammalian cells as a result of its activity. The three-dimensional structure of human NHE1 (hNHE1) is not known. Here, we modeled NHE1 based on the structure of MjNhaP1 of Methanocaldoccocus jannaschii in combination with biochemical surface accessibility data. hNHE1 contained 12 transmembrane segments including a characteristic Na+/H+ antiporter fold of two transmembrane segments with a helix-extended region-helix conformation crossing each other within the membrane. Amino acids 363-410 mapped principally to the extracellular surface as an extracellular loop (EL5). A large preponderance of amino acids shown to be surface accessible by biochemical experiments mapped near to, or on, the extracellular surface. Docking of Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitors to the extracellular surface suggested that inhibitor binding on an extracellular site is made up from several amino acids of different regions of the protein. The results present a novel testable, three-dimensional model illustrating NHE1 structure and accounting for experimental biochemical data.","Molecular modeling and inhibitor docking analysis of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform one.

0,Immune Infiltration Profiling in Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer and Their Clinical Significance: Study Based on Gene Expression Measurements,"Immune cell infiltration is associated with the prognosis of cancer. This study focused on the immune infiltration profiling and their association with survival outcome in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Research data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. CIBERSORT algorithm was applied to assess the relative proportions of 22 kinds of immune cells. Log-rank test was performed to compare the survival outcome of patients with different proportions of immune cells. The estimated hazard ratios were presented with forest plot. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate the adjusted associations between different types of infiltrating immune cells and survival prognosis controlling for other clinical features and confounders. With the CIBERSORT approach, we assessed the proportions of 22 infiltrating immune cells of 2050 cases with NSCLC. By conducting survival analysis, we found different survival outcomes among cases with different proportions of certain types of infiltrating immune cells.

Immune cell infiltration is associated with the prognosis of cancer. This study focused on the immune infiltration profiling and their association with survival outcome in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Research data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. CIBERSORT algorithm was applied to assess the relative proportions of 22 kinds of immune cells. Log-rank test was performed to compare the survival outcome of patients with different proportions of immune cells. The estimated hazard ratios were presented with forest plot. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate the adjusted associations between different types of infiltrating immune cells and survival prognosis controlling for other clinical features and confounders.

0,A diversity of interneurons and Hebbian plasticity facilitate rapid compressible learning in the hippocampus,"The hippocampus is able to rapidly learn incoming information, even if that information is only observed once. Furthermore, this information can be replayed in a compressed format in either forward or reverse modes during sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs). We leveraged state-of-the-art techniques in training recurrent spiking networks to demonstrate how primarily interneuron networks can achieve the following: (1) generate internal theta sequences to bind externally elicited spikes in the presence of inhibition from the medial septum; (2) compress learned spike sequences in the form of a SPW-R when septal inhibition is removed; (3) generate and refine high-frequency assemblies during SPW-R-mediated compression; and (4) regulate the inter-SPW interval timing between SPW-Rs in ripple clusters. From the fast timescale of neurons to the slow timescale of behaviors, interneuron networks serve as the scaffolding for one-shot learning by replaying, reversing, refining, and regulating spike sequences.","A diversity of interneurons and Hebbian plasticity facilitate rapid compressible learning in the hippocampus.

It is not known whether it also regulates oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in peroxisomes. Using affinity chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays we discovered that ceramide interacts with Hsd17b4, an enzyme critical for peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) generation. Immunocytochemistry showed that Hsd17b4 is distributed to ceramide-enriched mitochondria-associated membranes (CEMAMs). Molecular docking and in vitro mutagenesis experiments showed that ceramide binds to the sterol carrier protein 2-like domain in Hsd17b4 adjacent to peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1), the C-terminal signal for interaction with peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (Pex5), a peroxin mediating transport of Hsd17b4 into peroxisomes. Inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis induced translocation of Hsd17b4 from CEMAMs to peroxisomes, interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5, and upregulation of DHA. This data indicates a novel role of ceramide as a molecular switch regulating interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5 and peroxisomal function.","Ceramide regulates interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5 and function of peroxisomes.

RESULTS: A fetal weight example is included to illustrate the underlying discrepancy between the exact and approximate methods. Moreover, extensive numerical assessments were conducted to examine the relative performance of the two distinct procedures.

0,GAS: A genetic atlas selection strategy in multi-atlas segmentation framework,"Multi-Atlas based Segmentation (MAS) algorithms have been successfully applied to many medical image segmentation tasks, but their success relies on a large number of atlases and good image registration performance. Choosing well-registered atlases for label fusion is vital for an accurate segmentation. This choice becomes even more crucial when the segmentation involves organs characterized by a high anatomical and pathological variability. In this paper, we propose a new genetic atlas selection strategy (GAS) that automatically chooses the best subset of atlases to be used for segmenting the target image, on the basis of both image similarity and segmentation overlap. More precisely, the key idea of GAS is that if two images are similar, the performances of an atlas for segmenting each image are similar. Since the ground truth of each atlas is known, GAS first selects a predefined number of similar images to the target, then, for each one of them, finds a near-optimal subset of atlases by means of a genetic algorithm. All these near-optimal subsets are then combined and used to segment the target image. GAS was tested on single-label and multi-label segmentation problems. In the first case, we considered the segmentation of both the whole prostate and of the left ventricle of the heart from magnetic resonance images. Regarding multi-label problems, the zonal segmentation of the prostate into peripheral and transition zone was considered. The results showed that the performance of MAS algorithms statistically improved when GAS is used.","GAS: A genetic atlas selection strategy in multi-atlas segmentation framework.

One of its branches, computer vision, allows image recognition with high accuracy thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our goal was to train a CNN with transmitted light microscopy images to distinguish pluripotent stem cells from early differentiating cells. We induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to epiblast-like cells and took images at several time points from the initial stimulus. We found that the networks can be trained to recognize undifferentiated cells from differentiating cells with an accuracy higher than 99%. Successful prediction started just 20 min after the onset of differentiation. Furthermore, CNNs displayed great performance in several similar pluripotent stem cell (PSC) settings, including mesoderm differentiation in human induced PSCs. Accurate cellular morphology recognition in a simple microscopic set up may have a significant impact on how cell assays are performed in the near future. In this article, Miriuka and colleagues show that deep learning convolutional neural networks can be trained to accurately classify light microscopy images of pluripotent stem cells from those of early differentiating cells, only minutes after the differentiation stimulus. These algorithms thus provide novel tools to quantitatively characterize subtle changes in cell morphology.","Deep Learning Neural Networks Highly Predict Very Early Onset of Pluripotent Stem Cell Differentiation.

0,Virtual screening of naphthoquinone analogs for potent inhibitors against the cancer-signaling PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway,"The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the most commonly disrupted signaling pathways that plays a role in the development and pathogenicity of multiple cancers. Therefore, the critical proteins of this pathway have been targeted for anticancer therapy. The scientific community has increasingly been realizing the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of naphthoquinone analogs. These compounds constitute a major class of diverse sets of plant metabolites, which include various natural products and synthetic compounds with proven anticancer activity. The current study involved structural computational biology approaches to explore compounds from a diverse pool of naphthoquinone analogs that can inhibit key cancer-signaling proteins phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B, PKB (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The novel compound identified commonly among the top 10 dock score lists of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was selected for further study and proposed as a potential inhibitor of the 3 cancer-signaling proteins and an anticancer agent. Further, to check the docking accuracy and potential of the compound, post docking analyses, namely, binding comparison with the native ligand, the role of the interacting residue role in binding, predicted binding energy and dissociation constant calculations, etc., were performed. All these measures showed good-quality binding, and thus provide weight to our prediction of the novel compound as a pan PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor and an anticancer agent. Finally, to compare the binding and similarity in the active sites of the 3 protein kinases, a ligand-based active site alignment was performed and analyzed. Thus, the study proposed a novel naphthoquinone analog as a potential anticancer drug, and provided comparative structural insight into its binding to the 3 protein kinases.","Virtual screening of naphthoquinone analogs for potent inhibitors against the cancer-signaling PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

0,Common binding sites for cholesterol and neurosteroids on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel,"Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, and is required for mammalian pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) function. Computational studies suggest direct interactions between cholesterol and pLGICs but experimental evidence identifying specific binding sites is limited. In this study, we mapped cholesterol binding to Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a model pLGIC chosen for its high level of expression, existing crystal structure, and previous use as a prototypic pLGIC. Using two cholesterol analogue photolabeling reagents with the photoreactive moiety on opposite ends of the sterol, we identified two cholesterol binding sites: an intersubunit site between TM3 and TM1 of adjacent subunits and an intrasubunit site between TM1 and TM4. In both the inter- and intrasubunit sites, cholesterol is oriented such that the 3â€‘OH group points toward the center of the transmembrane domains rather than toward either the cytosolic or extracellular surfaces. We then compared this binding to that of the cholesterol metabolite, allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates pLGICs. The same binding pockets were identified for allopregnanolone and cholesterol, but the binding orientation of the two ligands was markedly different, with the 3â€‘OH group of allopregnanolone pointing to the intra- and extracellular termini of the transmembrane domains rather than to their centers. We also found that cholesterol increases, whereas allopregnanolone decreases the thermal stability of GLIC. These data indicate that cholesterol and neurosteroids bind to common hydrophobic pockets in the model pLGIC, GLIC, but that their effects depend on the orientation and specific molecular interactions unique to each sterol.","Common binding sites for cholesterol and neurosteroids on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel.

0,Selecting precise reference normal tissue samples for cancer research using a deep learning approach,"Background: Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Methods: We analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx. Results: Among 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that samples from GTEx can serve as reference normal samples for cancers, especially those do not have available adjacent tissue samples. A deep-learning based approach holds promise to select proper normal samples.","Selecting precise reference normal tissue samples for cancer research using a deep learning approach.

0,The physiological determinants of near-infrared spectroscopy-derived regional cerebral oxygenation in critically ill adults,"Background: To maintain adequate oxygen delivery to tissue, resuscitation of critically ill patients is guided by assessing surrogate markers of perfusion. As there is no direct indicator of cerebral perfusion used in routine critical care, identifying an accurate strategy to monitor brain perfusion is paramount. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique to quantify regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) that has been used for decades during cardiac surgery which has led to targeted algorithms to optimize rSO2 being developed. However, these targeted algorithms do not exist during critical care, as the physiological determinants of rSO2 during critical illness remain poorly understood. Materials and methods: This prospective observational study was an exploratory analysis of a nested cohort of patients within the CONFOCAL study (NCT02344043) who received high-fidelity vital sign monitoring. Adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years) admitted < 24 h to a medical/surgical intensive care unit were eligible if they had shock and/or required mechanical ventilation. Patients underwent rSO2 monitoring with the FORESIGHT oximeter for 24 h, vital signs were concurrently recorded, and clinically ordered arterial blood gas samples and hemoglobin concentration were also documented. Simultaneous multiple linear regression was performed using all available predictors, followed by model selection using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). Results: Our simultaneous multivariate model included age, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, pH, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and hemoglobin concentration. This model accounted for a significant proportion of variance in rSO2 (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.01) and was significantly associated with PaCO2 (p < 0.05) and hemoglobin concentration (p < 0.01). Our selected regression model using AICc accounted for a significant proportion of variance in rSO2 (R2 = 0.54, p < 0.01) and was significantly related to age (p < 0.05), PaCO2 (p <Â 0.01), hemoglobin (p < 0.01), and heart rate (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Known and established physiological determinants of oxygen delivery accounted for a significant proportion of the rSO2 signal, which provides evidence that NIRS is a viable modality to assess cerebral oxygenation in critically ill adults.

However, sequencing data from bulk tumor samples often have considerable ambiguity in clonal composition, complicating the inference of ancestral relationships between clones. We introduce Cancer Analysis of Longitudinal Data through Evolutionary Reconstruction (CALDER), an algorithm to infer phylogenetic trees from longitudinal bulk DNA sequencing data. CALDER explicitly models a longitudinally observed phylogeny incorporating constraints that longitudinal sampling imposes on phylogeny reconstruction. We show on simulated bulk tumor data that longitudinal constraints substantially reduce ambiguity in phylogeny reconstruction and that CALDER outperforms existing methods that do not leverage this longitudinal information. On real data from two chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we find that CALDER reconstructs more plausible and parsimonious phylogenies than existing methods, with CALDER phylogenies containing fewer tumor clones per sample. CALDER's use of longitudinal information will be advantageous in further studies of tumor heterogeneity and evolution.","CALDER: Inferring Phylogenetic Trees from Longitudinal Tumor Samples.

However, sequencing data from bulk tumor samples often have considerable ambiguity in clonal composition, complicating the inference of ancestral relationships between clones. We introduce Cancer Analysis of Longitudinal Data through Evolutionary Reconstruction (CALDER), an algorithm to infer phylogenetic trees from longitudinal bulk DNA sequencing data. CALDER explicitly models a longitudinally observed phylogeny incorporating constraints that longitudinal sampling imposes on phylogeny reconstruction. We show on simulated bulk tumor data that longitudinal constraints substantially reduce ambiguity in phylogeny reconstruction and that CALDER outperforms existing methods that do not leverage this longitudinal information. On real data from two chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we find that CALDER reconstructs more plausible and parsimonious phylogenies than existing methods, with CALDER phylogenies containing fewer tumor clones per sample. CALDER's use of longitudinal information will be advantageous in further studies of tumor heterogeneity and evolution."

0,Expectation-induced modulation of metastable activity underlies faster coding of sensory stimuli,"Sensory stimuli can be recognized more rapidly when they are expected. This phenomenon depends on expectation affecting the cortical processing of sensory information. However, the mechanisms responsible for the effects of expectation on sensory circuits remain elusive. In the present study, we report a novel computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of coding observed in the gustatory cortex of alert rats. We use a recurrent spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential features of cortical activity, such as its intrinsically generated metastable dynamics. Relying on network theory and computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our model's predictions were confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrating how the modulation of ongoing activity can shape sensory coding. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of expectation and ascribe an alternative functional role to intrinsically generated, metastable activity.","Expectation-induced modulation of metastable activity underlies faster coding of sensory stimuli.

0,Structural bioinformatics insights into ATP binding mechanism in zebrafish (Danio rerio) cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (zCDKL5) protein,"In mammalian systems, the conserved cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) control the process of cell division and curb the transcription mechanism in response to diverse signaling events that are essential for the catalytic activity. In zebrafish, zCDKL5 portrays differential expression profiling in several tissues and presumed to play a vital role in the neuronal development. In this present study, the sequence-structure relationship and mode of ATP binding in zCDKL5 was unveiled through theoretical modeling, molecular docking, and MD simulations. Like human CDKs, the modeled zCDKL5 was found to be bipartite in nature, where, ATP binds to the central cavity of the catalytic domain through a strong network of H-bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. MD simulation portrayed that conserved residues, viz, Ile10, Gly11, Glu12, Val18, Val64, Glu81, Cys143, and Asp144 were indispensable for tight anchoring of ATP and contribute to the stability of the zCDKL5-ATP complex. MM/PBSA binding free energy analysis displayed that van der Waal energy (Î”G vwd) and Electrostatic energy (Î”G ele) were the major contributors towards the overall binding free energy. Thus, the comparative structural bioinformatics approach has shed new insights into the dynamics and ATP binding mechanism of zCDKL5. The results from the study will help to undertake further research on the role of phosphorylated CDKL5 in the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in higher eukaryotic systems.","Structural bioinformatics insights into ATP binding mechanism in zebrafish (Danio rerio) cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (zCDKL5) protein.

0,Improving workflow control in radiotherapy using discrete-event simulation,"BACKGROUND: In radiotherapy, minimizing the time between referral and start of treatment (waiting time) is important to possibly mitigate tumor growth and avoid psychological distress in cancer patients. Radiotherapy pre-treatment workflow is driven by the scheduling of the first irradiation session, which is usually set right after consultation (pull strategy) or can alternatively be set after the pre-treatment workflow has been completed (push strategy). The objective of this study is to assess the impact of using pull and push strategies and explore alternative interventions for improving timeliness in radiotherapy. METHODS: Discrete-event simulation is used to model the patient flow of a large radiotherapy department of a Dutch hospital. A staff survey, interviews with managers, and historical data from 2017 are used to generate model inputs, in which fluctuations in patient inflow and resource availability are considered. RESULTS: A hybrid (40% pull / 60% push) strategy representing the current practice (baseline case) leads to 12% lower average waiting times and 48% fewer first appointment rebooks when compared to a full pull strategy, which in turn leads to 41% fewer patients breaching the waiting time targets. An additional scenario analysis performed on the baseline case showed that spreading consultation slots evenly throughout the week can provide a 21% reduction in waiting times. CONCLUSIONS: A 100% pull strategy allows for more patients starting treatment within the waiting time targets than a hybrid strategy, in spite of slightly longer waiting times and more first appointment rebooks. Our algorithm can be used by radiotherapy policy makers to identify the optimal balance between push and pull strategies to ensure timely treatments while providing patient-centered care adapted to their specific conditions.","Improving workflow control in radiotherapy using discrete-event simulation.

Purpose To compare contrast opacification in CT angiography of the aorta between a cohort with fixed trigger delay and a cohort with patient-specific individualized trigger delay for contrast media timing with bolus tracking. Materials and Methods In this prospective study (January-August 2018), CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta with bolus tracking was performed in two different study cohorts: one with a fixed trigger delay of 4 seconds (fixed cohort) and one with a patient-specific trigger delay (individualized cohort). All CT and contrast media protocol parameters were kept identical among cohorts. Objective image quality was evaluated by one reader; two readers assessed subjective image quality. Student t test was used to test for differences in mean attenuation; the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test for differences in noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective image quality. Results The fixed cohort had 108 study participants (16 women; mean age +/- standard deviation, 72 years +/- 10); the individualized cohort had 108 participants (16 women; mean age, 72 years +/- 12). The trigger delay in the individualized cohort ranged from 6.4-11.3 seconds (mean, 9.2 seconds). There was higher overall attenuation in the individualized cohort than in the fixed cohort (486 HU +/- 92 for individualized vs 438 HU +/- 99 for fixed; P < .001), with increasing differences from the aortic arch (8 HU) to the iliac arteries (95 HU). The regression model indicated uniform attenuation in the individualized cohort and decreasing attenuation in the fixed cohort (decrease of 87 HU by the iliac arteries; P < .001). There was no difference between cohorts for image noise (20 vs 19; P = .41), but contrast-to-noise ratio (21 vs 19; P = .04) and subjective image quality were higher in the individualized cohort than in the fixed cohort (excellent or good image quality, 100% vs 67%; P < .001). Conclusion Compared with a fixed delay time after bolus tracking, a patient-specific individualized trigger delay improves image quality and provides uniform contrast attenuation for CT angiography of the aorta.

In current work, bioinformatics analyses were carried out on Trace amine (TA)-associated receptor 6 (TAAR6) to recognize the potential drugs and compounds against SZ. Comparative modeling and threading-based approaches were utilized for the structure prediction of TAAR6. Fifty-nine predicted structures were evaluated by various model assessment techniques and final model having only eight amino acids in the outlier region and 98.5% overall quality factor was chosen for further pharmacoinformatics and molecular docking analyses. From an extensive literature review, 11 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs were analyzed by computational techniques and Aripiprazole was found as the most effective drug against SZ by targeting TAAR6. Here, we report five novel molecules which exhibited the highest binding affinity, effective drug properties, and interestingly, observed better results than the approved selected drugs against SZ by targeting TAAR6. The docking analyses revealed that Arg-92, Trp-98, Gln-191, Thr-192, Ala-290, Cys-291, Tyr-293, and Glu-294 residues were observed as critical interacting residues in receptor-ligand interactions.

0,Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identify amino acid residues underlying the substrate selection mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporters 1 (hMCT1) and 4 (hMCT4),"Human monocarboxylate transporters (hMCTs/SLC16As) mediate the transport of monocarboxylic compounds across plasma membranes. Among the hMCTs, hMCT1 and hMCT4 are expressed in various tissues, and transport substrates involved in energy metabolism. Both transporters mediate l-lactate transport, but, although hMCT1 also transports l-5-oxoproline (l-OPro), this compound is minimally transported by hMCT4. Thus, we were interested in the molecular mechanism responsible for the difference in substrate specificity between hMCT1 and hMCT4. Therefore, we generated 3D structure models of hMCT1 and hMCT4 to identify amino acid residues involved in the substrate specificity of these transporters. We found that the substrate specificity of hMCT1 was regulated by residues involved in turnover number (M69) and substrate affinity (F367), and these residues were responsible for recognizing (directly or indirectly) the â€“NHâ€“ moiety of l-OPro. Furthermore, our homology model of hMCT1 predicted that M69 and F367 participate in hydrophobic interactions with another region of hMCT1, emphasizing its potentially important role in the binding and translocation cycle of l-OPro. Mutagenesis experiments supported this model, showing that efficient l-OPro transport required a hydrophobic, long linear structure at position 69 and a hydrophobic, Î³-branched structure at position 367. Our work demonstrated that the amino acid residues, M69 and F367, are key molecular elements for the transport of l-OPro by hMCT1. These two residues may be involved in substrate recognition and/or substrate-induced conformational changes.","Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identify amino acid residues underlying the substrate selection mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporters 1 (hMCT1) and 4 (hMCT4).

0,Identification and weighting of kidney allocation criteria: a novel multi-expert fuzzy method,"BACKGROUND: Kidney allocation is a multi-criteria and complex decision-making problem, which should also consider ethical issues in addition to the medical aspects. Leading countries in this field use a point scoring system to allocate kidneys. Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify and weight the kidney allocation criteria considering the balance between utility and equity. METHODS: To do this, a new fuzzy hybrid approach is proposed, which consists of two steps: In the first step, Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is used to identify the effective criteria in the kidney allocation algorithm. In the second step, Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (IF-AHP) is employed to determine the weight of the criteria. RESULTS: The results showed that the highest weight belongs to ""Medical emergency"" criterion and the lowest weight to ""5 HLA mismatches"", which is similar to Euro-transplant kidney allocation system (ETKAS). The developed method is evaluated in two steps. First, the proposed model is implemented using a real case study from the Iranian Kidney Allocation System.

However, incomplete reprogramming is a major barrier to SCNT, and the assessment of reprogramming is limited to preimplantation embryos and tissues from dead and/or adult tissue. Thus, lifelong monitoring in SCNT dogs can be useful to evaluate the SCNT service dogs for propagation. We applied microarray and qRT-PCR to profile of mRNA and miRNA in whole blood samples collected from four cloned dogs (S), three age-matched control dogs (A), and a donor dog (D). In the analysis of differentially expressed genes in S-A, A-D, and S-D pairs, most genomes were completely reprogrammed and rejuvenated in the cloned offspring.

0,Phthalides serve as potent modulators to boost fetal hemoglobin induction therapy for Î²-hemoglobinopathies,"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction therapy has become the most promising strategy for treating Î²-hemoglobinopathies, including sickle-cell diseases and Î²-thalassemia. However, subtle but critical structural difference exists between HbF and normal adult hemoglobin (HbA), which inevitably leads to reduced binding of the endogenous modulator 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to HbF and thus increased oxygen affinity and decreased oxygen transport efficiency of HbF. We combined the oxygen equilibrium experiments, resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy, and molecular docking modeling, and we discuss 2 phthalides, z-butylidenephthalide and z-ligustilide, that can effectively lower the oxygen affinity of HbF. They adjust it to a level closer to that of HbA and make it a more satisfactory oxygen carrier for adults. From the oxygen equilibrium curve measurements, we show that the 2 phthalides are more effective than 2,3-BPG for modulating HbF. The RR spectra show that phthalides allosterically stabilize the oxygenated HbF in the low oxygen affinity conformation, and the molecular docking modeling reveals that the 2 chosen phthalides interact with HbF via the cleft around the Î³1/Î³2 interface with a binding strength ;1.6 times stronger than that of 2,3-BPG. We discuss the implications of z-butylidenephthalide and z-ligustilide in boosting the efficacy of HbF induction therapy to mitigate the clinical severities of Î²-hemoglobinopathies.","Phthalides serve as potent modulators to boost fetal hemoglobin induction therapy for Î²-hemoglobinopathies.

However, subtle but critical structural difference exists between HbF and normal adult hemoglobin (HbA), which inevitably leads to reduced binding of the endogenous modulator 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to HbF and thus increased oxygen affinity and decreased oxygen transport efficiency of HbF. We combined the oxygen equilibrium experiments, resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy, and molecular docking modeling, and we discuss 2 phthalides, z-butylidenephthalide and z-ligustilide, that can effectively lower the oxygen affinity of HbF. They adjust it to a level closer to that of HbA and make it a more satisfactory oxygen carrier for adults. From the oxygen equilibrium curve measurements, we show that the 2 phthalides are more effective than 2,3-BPG for modulating HbF. The RR spectra show that phthalides allosterically stabilize the oxygenated HbF in the low oxygen affinity conformation, and the molecular docking modeling reveals that the 2 chosen phthalides interact with HbF via the cleft around the Î³1/Î³2 interface with a binding strength ;1.6 times stronger than that of 2,3-BPG. We discuss the implications of z-butylidenephthalide and z-ligustilide in boosting the efficacy of HbF induction therapy to mitigate the clinical severities of Î²-hemoglobinopathies."

QTc prolongation calls for cautious use of drugs with a propensity to inhibit hERG channels. The STARS trial has been undertaken to investigate the efficacy of sarizotan, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, at correcting RTT respiratory abnormalities. The present study investigated whether sarizotan inhibits hERG potassium channels and prolongs ventricular repolarization. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements were made at 37 Â°C from hERG-expressing HEK293 cells. Docking analysis was conducted using a recent cryo-EM structure of hERG. Sarizotan was a potent inhibitor of hERG current (IhERG; IC50 of 183 nM) and of native ventricular IKr from guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. 100 nM and 1 Î¼M sarizotan prolonged ventricular action potential (AP) duration (APD90) by 14.1 Â± 3.3% (n = 6) and 29.8 Â± 3.1% (n = 5) respectively and promoted AP triangulation. High affinity IhERG inhibition by sarizotan was contingent upon channel gating and intact inactivation. Mutagenesis experiments and docking analysis implicated F557, S624 and Y652 residues in sarizotan binding, with weaker contribution from F656. In conclusion, sarizotan inhibits IKr/IhERG, accessing key binding residues on channel gating. This action and consequent ventricular AP prolongation occur at concentrations relevant to those proposed to treat breathing dysrhythmia in RTT. Sarizotan should only be used in RTT patients with careful evaluation of risk factors for QTc prolongation.","Potent hERG channel inhibition by sarizotan, an investigative treatment for Rett Syndrome.

0,Genome-wide de novo L1 Retrotransposition Connects Endonuclease Activity with Replication,"L1 retrotransposon-derived sequences comprise approximately 17% of the human genome. Darwinian selective pressures alter L1 genomic distributions during evolution, confounding the ability to determine initial L1 integration preferences. Here, we generated high-confidence datasets of greater than 88,000 engineered L1 insertions in human cell lines that act as proxies for cells that accommodate retrotransposition in vivo. Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1 endonuclease activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences, demonstrated that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed regions, or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the L1 endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA replication templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus, acquisition of an endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate into replicating DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed retrotransposon. The examination of de novo engineered L1 retrotransposition events in cultured human cells reveals that L1 endonuclease activity and DNA replication dictate L1 insertion preferences and promote its widespread integration throughout the human genome.","Genome-wide de novo L1 Retrotransposition Connects Endonuclease Activity with Replication.

WP1130 has shown potent activity against a variety of cancer but whether WP1130 has anti-T-ALL activity is not clear. USP24, one target of WP1130, is one of the largest deubiquitinases and its detailed mechanism is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to explore whether WP1130 could suppress T-ALL and the role of USP24 in T-ALL. Methods: Molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay were performed to determine whether and how WP1130 directly interact with USP24. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential assay was measured via Rhodamine 123 staining. USP24 was reactivated using the deactivated CRISPR-associated protein 9 (dCas9)-synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system. The in vivo results were examined by tumor xenografts in NOD-SCID mice. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS software package. Results: WP1130 treatment decreased the viability and induces apoptosis of T-ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of USP24 but not USP9X could significantly induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of T-ALL cells. Oncomine database showed that USP24 expression was upregulated in T-ALL samples and Kaplan-Meier results indicated that the USP24 was negatively but USP9X was positively associated with survival in T-ALL patients. Additionally, we proposed that WP1130 directly interacts with the activity site pocket of USP24 in T-ALL cells, which leads to the decrease of its substrates Mcl-1. Mechanistically, WP1130 induces apoptosis by accelerating the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential via USP24-Mcl-1 axis. Conclusions: Altogether, using WP1130 as a chemical probe, we demonstrate that USP24 but not USP9X is a novel target in T-ALL cells. Moreover, we uncovered that WP1130 induces apoptosis by accelerating the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential via USP24-Mcl-1 axis. These results provide that USP24-Mcl-1 axis may represent a novel strategy in the treatment of T-ALL and WP1130 is a promising lead compound for developing anti-T-ALL drugs.","WP1130 reveals USP24 as a novel target in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

However, available data on the human ovary are limited and fundamental differences between animal models and humans are hampering researchers in their quest for more extensive knowledge of human ovarian physiology and key reproductive proteins that need to be preserved. We therefore turned to multi-dimensional label-free mass spectrometry to analyze human ovarian cortex, as it is a high-throughput and conclusive technique providing information on the proteomic composition of complex tissues like the ovary. In-depth proteomic profiling through two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, Western blotting, histological and immunohistochemical analyses, and data mining helped us to confidently identify 1508 proteins. Moreover, our method allowed us to chart the most complete representation so far of the ovarian matrisome, defined as the ensemble of extracellular matrix proteins and associated factors, including more than 80 proteins. In conclusion, this study will provide a better understanding of ovarian proteomics, with a detailed characterization of the ovarian follicle microenvironment, in order to enable bioengineers to create biomimetic scaffolds for transplantation and three-dimensional in vitro culture.

0,"Reversal effect of FW-04-806, a macrolide dilactone compound, on multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro and in vivo","Background: Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, has been proved to be a major trigger for multidrug resistance (MDR) in certain types of cancer. A promising approach to reverse MDR is the combined use of nontoxic and potent ABC transporters inhibitor with conventional anticancer drugs. We previously reported that FW-04-806 (conglobatin) as a novel Hsp90 inhibitor with low toxicity, capable of attenuating Hsp90/Cdc37 /clients interactions and producing antitumor action in vitro and in vivo. Our early activity screening found that FW-04-806 at non-cytotoxic concentration was able to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents on the ABCB1 overexpressing cells. Therefore, we speculated that FW-04-806 might be a promising MDR reversal agent. In the present study we further investigated its reversal effect of MDR induced by ABC transporters in vitro and in vivo. Methods: MTT assay in vitro and xenograftes in vivo were used to investigate reversal effect of FW-04-806 on MDR in ABCB1 or ABCG2 overexpressing cancer cells. To understand the mechanisms for the MDR reversal, we examined the effects of FW-04-806 on intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX, adriamycin, adr)/Rhodamine 123 (Rho 123), efflux of doxorubicin, expression levels of gene and protein of ABCB1 or ABCG2 and ATPase activity of ABCB1, and carried out molecular docking between FW-04-806 and human ABCB1. Results: The results indicated that FW-04-806 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of substrate chemotherapeutic agents on the ABCB1 or ABCG2 overexpressing cells in vitro and in vivo suggesting its reversal MDR effects. FW-04-806 increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX or Rho123 by inhibiting the efflux function of ABC transporters in MDR cells rather than in their parental sensitive cells. However, unlike other ABC transporter inhibitors, FW-04-806 had no effect on the ATPase activity nor on the expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 on either mRNA or protein level. Molecular docking suggested that FW-04-806 may have lower affinity to the ATPase site, which was consistent with its no significant effect on the ATPase activity of ABCB1; However FW-04-806 may bind to substrate binding site in TMDs more stably than substrate anticancer drugs therefore obstruct the anticancer drugs pumped out of the cell. Conclusions: FW-04-806 is a compound that has both anti-tumor and reversal MDR effects, and its antitumor clinical application is worth further study.

Phosphopeptides from three strains, type I (RH strain), type II (PRU strain) and ToxoDB#9 (PYS strain), were enriched by titanium dioxide (TiO2) affinity chromatography and quantified using iTRAQ technology. A total of 1,441 phosphopeptides, 1,250 phosphorylation sites and 759 phosphoproteins were detected. In addition, 392, 298, and 436 differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DEPs) were identified in RH strain when comparing RH/PRU strains, in PRU strain when comparing PRU/PYS strains, and in PYS strain when comparing PYS/RH strains, respectively. Functional characterization of the DEPs using GO, KEGG, and STRING analyses revealed marked differences between the three strains. In silico kinase substrate motif analysis of the DEPs revealed three (RxxS, SxxE, and SxxxE), three (RxxS, SxxE, and SP), and five (SxxE, SP, SxE, LxRxxS, and RxxS) motifs in RH strain when comparing RH/PRU strains, in PRU strain when comparing PRU/PYS, and in PYS strain when comparing PYS/RH strains, respectively. This suggests that multiple overrepresented protein kinases including PKA, PKG, CKII, IKK, and MAPK could be involved in such a difference between T. gondii strains.

Here, we report the results of patient-reported outcomes of this study. Methods: In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PROSPER trial, done at 254 study sites worldwide, patients aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of up to 10 months were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice web recognition system to receive oral enzalutamide (160 mg per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by prostate-specific antigen doubling time and baseline use of a bone-targeting agent. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, reported elsewhere. Secondary efficacy endpoints, reported here, were pain progression (assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form [BPI-SF] questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-PR25], the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Levels health questionnaire visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-FL, EQ-VAS], and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P] questionnaires). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, week 17, and every 16 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. We used predefined questionnaire thresholds to identify clinically meaningful changes. Enrolment for PROSPER is complete and follow-up continues. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02003924. Findings: Between Nov 26, 2013, and June 28, 2017, 1401 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive enzalutamide (n=933) or placebo (n=468). Median follow-up was 18Â·5 months (IQR 10Â·7â€“29Â·2) in the enzalutamide group and 15Â·1 months (7Â·4â€“25Â·9) in the placebo group. Patient-reported outcome scores at baseline were similar between groups.

Interpretation: Patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving enzalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival than did those who received placebo, while maintaining low pain levels and prostate cancer symptom burden and high health-related quality of life. Enzalutamide showed a clinical benefit by delaying pain progression, symptom worsening, and decrease in functional status, compared with placebo. These findings suggest that enzalutamide is a treatment option that should be discussed with patients presenting with high-risk, non- metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Background: In the PROSPER trial, enzalutamide significantly improved metastasis-free survival in patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we report the results of patient-reported outcomes of this study. Methods: In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PROSPER trial, done at 254 study sites worldwide, patients aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of up to 10 months were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice web recognition system to receive oral enzalutamide (160 mg per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by prostate-specific antigen doubling time and baseline use of a bone-targeting agent. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, reported elsewhere. Secondary efficacy endpoints, reported here, were pain progression (assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form [BPI-SF] questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-PR25], the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Levels health questionnaire visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-FL, EQ-VAS], and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P] questionnaires). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, week 17, and every 16 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. We used predefined questionnaire thresholds to identify clinically meaningful changes. Enrolment for PROSPER is complete and follow-up continues. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02003924. Findings: Between Nov 26, 2013, and June 28, 2017, 1401 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive enzalutamide (n=933) or placebo (n=468). Median follow-up was 18Â·5 months (IQR 10Â·7â€“29Â·2) in the enzalutamide group and 15Â·1 months (7Â·4â€“25Â·9) in the placebo group.

0,Small molecule glycomimetics inhibit vascular calcification via c-Met/Notch3/HES1 signalling,"Background/Aims: Vascular calcification represents a huge clinical problem contributing to adverse cardiovascular events, with no effective treatment currently available. Upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor has been linked with vascular calcification, and thus, represent a potential target in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy. Glycomimetics have been shown to interrupt HGF-receptor signalling, therefore this study investigated the effect of novel glycomimetics on osteogenic signalling and vascular calcification in vitro. Methods: Primary human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs) were induced by Î²-glycerophosphate (Î²-GP) and treated with 4 glycomimetic compounds (C1-C4). The effect of Î²-GP and C1-C4 on alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteogenic markers and c-Met/Notch3/HES1 signalling was determined using colorimetric assays, qRT-PCR and western blotting respectively. Results: C1-C4 significantly attenuated Î²-GP-induced calcification, as shown by Alizarin Red S staining and calcium content by day 14. In addition, C1-C4 reduced ALP activity and prevented upregulation of the osteogenic markers, BMP-2, Runx2, Msx2 and OPN. Furthermore, Î²-GP increased c-Met phosphorylation at day 21, an effect ameliorated by C2 and C4 and the c-Met inhibitor, crizotinib. We next interrogated the effects of the Notch inhibitor DAPT and confirmed an inhibition of Î²-GP up-regulated Notch3 protein by C2, DAPT and crizotinib compared to controls. Hes-1 protein upregulation by Î²-GP, was also significantly downregulated by C2 and DAPT. GOLD docking analysis identified a potential binding interaction of C1-C4 to HGF which will be investigated further. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glycomimetics have potent anti-calcification properties acting via HGF/c-Met and Notch signalling.","Small molecule glycomimetics inhibit vascular calcification via c-Met/Notch3/HES1 signalling.

0,A step beyond the hygiene hypothesis-immune-mediated classes determined in a population-based study,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidity patterns of childhood infections, atopic diseases, and adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are related to immune system programming conditions. The aim of this study was to make a step beyond the hygiene hypothesis and to comprehensively classify these patterns with latent class analysis (LCA). A second aim was to characterize the classes by associations with immunological, clinical, and sociodemographic variables. METHODS: LCA was applied to data from the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study (N = 4874, age range 35-82 years) separately for men and women. It was based on survey information on chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex, pertussis, scarlet fever, hay fever, asthma, eczema, urticaria, drug allergy, interparental violence, parental maltreatment, and trauma in early childhood. Subsequently, we examined how immune-mediated classes were reflected in leukocyte counts, inflammatory markers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, hsCRP), chronic inflammatory diseases, and mental disorders, and how they differed across social classes and birth cohorts. RESULTS: LCA results with five classes were selected for further analysis. Latent classes were similar in both sexes and were labeled according to their associations as neutral, resilient, atopic, mixed (comprising infectious and atopic diseases), and ACE class. They came across with specific differences in biomarker levels. Mental disorders typically displayed increased lifetime prevalence rates in the atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes, and decreased rates in the resilient class. The same patterns were apparent in chronic inflammatory diseases, except that the ACE class was relevant specifically in women but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically determine immune-mediated classes that evolve early in life. They display characteristic associations with biomarker levels and somatic and psychiatric diseases occurring later in life. Moreover, they show different distributions across social classes and allow to better understand the mechanisms beyond the changes in the prevalence of chronic somatic and psychiatric diseases.","A step beyond the hygiene hypothesis-immune-mediated classes determined in a population-based study.

Here, we used mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to map the mediator lipidome during the transition from inflammation to resolution and regeneration in skeletal muscle injury. We observed temporal regulation of glycerophospholipids and production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (for example, leukotrienes and prostaglandins) and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (for example, resolvins and lipoxins) that were modulated by ibuprofen. These time-dependent profiles were recapitulated in sorted neutrophils and Ly6C(hi) and Ly6C(lo) muscle-infiltrating macrophages, with a distinct pro-resolving signature observed in Ly6C(lo) macrophages. RNA sequencing of macrophages stimulated with resolvin D2 showed similarities to transcriptional changes found during the temporal transition from Ly6C(hi) macrophage to Ly6C(lo) macrophage. In vivo, resolvin D2 increased Ly6C(lo) macrophages and functional improvement of the regenerating muscle. These results reveal dynamic lipid mediator signatures of innate immune cells and provide a proof of concept for their exploitable effector roles in muscle regeneration.","Dynamic changes to lipid mediators support transitions among macrophage subtypes during muscle regeneration.

It is employed for the analysis of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor image (DTI)-derived quantities, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and fibre orientation, across multiple subjects. A hybrid Student's t-Watson-Gaussian mixture model-based non-rigid registration framework is formulated for the joint registration and clustering of voxel-wise DTI-derived data, acquired from multiple subjects. The proposed approach jointly estimates the non-rigid transformations necessary to register an unbiased mean template (represented as a 7-dimensional hybrid point set comprising spatial positions, fibre orientations and FA values) to white matter regions of interest (ROIs), and approximates the joint distribution of voxel spatial positions, their associated principal diffusion axes, and FA. Specific white matter ROIs, namely, the corpus callosum and cingulum, are analysed across healthy control (HC) subjects (K = 20 samples) and patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (K = 20 samples) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) (K = 20 samples) using the proposed framework, facilitating inter-group comparisons of FA and fibre orientations.

0,"Incorporating repeated measurements into prediction models in the critical care setting: a framework, systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: The incorporation of repeated measurements into multivariable prediction research may greatly enhance predictive performance. However, the methodological possibilities vary widely and a structured overview of the possible and utilized approaches lacks. Therefore, we [1] propose a structured framework for these approaches, [2] determine what methods are currently used to incorporate repeated measurements in prediction research in the critical care setting and, where possible, [3] assess the added discriminative value of incorporating repeated measurements. METHODS: The proposed framework consists of three domains: the observation window (static or dynamic), the processing of the raw data (raw data modelling, feature extraction and reduction) and the type of modelling. A systematic review was performed to identify studies which incorporate repeated measurements to predict (e.g. mortality) in the critical care setting. The within-study difference in c-statistics between models with versus without repeated measurements were obtained and pooled in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: From the 2618 studies found, 29 studies incorporated multiple repeated measurements. The annual number of studies with repeated measurements increased from 2.8/year (2000-2005) to 16.0/year (2016-2018). The majority of studies that incorporated repeated measurements for prediction research used a dynamic observation window, and extracted features directly from the data. Differences in c statistics ranged from -â€‰0.048 to 0.217 in favour of models that utilize repeated measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated measurements are increasingly common to predict events in the critical care domain, but their incorporation is lagging. A framework of possible approaches could aid researchers to optimize future prediction models.","Incorporating repeated measurements into prediction models in the critical care setting: a framework, systematic review and meta-analysis.

The overexpression of CAMKIV is directly associated with the development of different types of cancers. Hesperidin is abundantly found in citrus fruits and exhibits wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anticancerous effects. We have investigated binding mechanism of hesperidin with the CAMKIV using molecular docking methods followed by fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetric assays. An appreciable binding affinity of hesperidin was observed with CAMKIV during fluorescence quenching and isothermal titration calorimetric studies. Efficacy of hesperidin to inhibit the growth of human hepatic carcinoma (HepG2) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cancer cell lines were investigated. Hesperidin has significantly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells and induces apoptosis by activating the caspase-3-dependent intrinsic pathway through the upregulation of proapoptotic Bax protein. Hesperidin treatment reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells. All these observations clearly anticipated hesperidin a potent inhibitor of CAMKIV which may be further exploited a newer therapeutic approach for the management of different cancer types.","Hesperidin-CAMKIV interaction and its impact on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the human hepatic carcinoma and neuroblastoma cells.

0,Disparities in Acceptance of Deceased Donor Kidneys between the United States and France and Estimated Effects of Increased US Acceptance,"Importance: Approximately 3500 donated kidneys are discarded in the United States each year, drawing concern from Medicare and advocacy groups. Objective: To estimate the effects of more aggressive allograft acceptance practices on the donor pool and allograft survival for the population of US wait-listed kidney transplant candidates. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationwide study using validated registries from the United States and France comprising comprehensive cohorts of deceased donors with organs offered to kidney transplant centers between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. Data were analyzed between September 1, 2018, and April 5, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was kidney allograft discard. The secondary outcome was allograft failure after transplantation. We used logistic regression to model organ acceptance and discard practices in both countries. We then quantified using computer simulation models the number of kidneys discarded in the United States that a more aggressive system would have instead used for transplantation. Finally, based on actual survival data, we quantified the additional years of allograft life that a redesigned US system would have saved. Findings: In the United States, 156089 kidneys were recovered from deceased donors between 2004 and 2014, of which 128102 were transplanted, and 27987 (17.9%) were discarded. In France, among the 29984 kidneys recovered between 2004 and 2014, 27252 were transplanted, and 2732 (9.1%, P <.001 vs United States) were discarded. The mean (SD) age of kidneys transplanted in the United States was 36.51 (17.02) years vs 50.91 (17.34) years in France (P <.001). Kidney quality showed little change in the United States over time (mean [SD] kidney donor risk index [KDRI], 1.30 [0.48] in 2004 vs 1.32 [0.46] in 2014), whereas a steadily rising KDRI in France reflected a temporal trend of more aggressive organ use (mean [SD] KDRI, 1.37 [0.47] in 2004 vs 1.74 [0.72] in 2014; P <.001). We applied the French-based allocation model to the population of US deceased donor kidneys and found that 17435 (62%) of kidneys discarded in the United States would have instead been transplanted under the French system. We further determined that a redesigned system with more aggressive organ acceptance practices would generate an additional 132445 allograft life-years in the United States over the 10-year observation period. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater acceptance of kidneys from deceased donors who are older and have more comorbidities could provide major survival benefits to the population of US wait-listed patients.","Disparities in Acceptance of Deceased Donor Kidneys between the United States and France and Estimated Effects of Increased US Acceptance.

As yet, however, limited studies have been aimed at assessing mitotic counts as a prognostic factor for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). Here, we assessed the prognostic value of absolute mitotic counts for TNBC, using both deep learning and manual procedures. Methods: A retrospective TNBC cohort (n = 298) was used. The absolute manual mitotic count was assessed by averaging counts from three independent observers. Deep learning was performed using a convolutional neural network on digitized H&E slides. Multivariable Cox regression models for relapse-free survival and overall survival served as baseline models. These were expanded with dichotomized mitotic counts, attempting every possible cut-off value, and evaluated by means of the c-statistic. Results: We found that per 2Â mm2 averaged manual mitotic counts ranged from 1 to 187 (mean 37.6, SD 23.4), whereas automatic counts ranged from 1 to 269 (mean 57.6; SD 42.2). None of the cut-off values improved the modelsâ€™ baseline c-statistic, for both manual and automatic assessments. Conclusions: Based on our results we conclude that the level of proliferation, as reflected by mitotic count, does not serve as a prognostic factor for TNBC. Therefore, TNBC patient management based on mitotic count should be discouraged.","Deep learning and manual assessment show that the absolute mitotic count does not contain prognostic information in triple negative breast cancer.

0,"A functional agonist of insect olfactory receptors: Behavior, physiology and structure","Chemical signaling is ubiquitous and employs a variety of receptor types to detect the cacophony of molecules relevant for each living organism. Insects, our most diverse taxon, have evolved unique olfactory receptors with as little as 10% sequence identity between receptor types. We have identified a promiscuous volatile, 2-methyltetrahydro-3-furanone (coffee furanone), that elicits chemosensory and behavioral activity across multiple insect orders and receptors. In vivo and in vitro physiology showed that coffee furanone was detected by roughly 80% of the recorded neurons expressing the insect-specific olfactory receptor complex in the antenna of Drosophila melanogaster, at concentrations similar to other known, and less promiscuous, ligands. Neurons expressing specialized receptors, other chemoreceptor types, or mutants lacking the complex entirely did not respond to this compound. This indicates that coffee furanone is a promiscuous ligand for the insect olfactory receptor complex itself and did not induce non-specific cellular responses. In addition, we present homology modeling and docking studies with selected olfactory receptors that suggest conserved interaction regions for both coffee furanone and known ligands. Apart from its physiological activity, this known food additive elicits a behavioral response for several insects, including mosquitoes, flies, and cockroaches. A broad-scale behaviorally active molecule non-toxic to humans thus has significant implications for health and agriculture. Coffee furanone serves as a unique tool to unlock molecular, physiological, and behavioral relationships across this diverse receptor family and animal taxa.","A functional agonist of insect olfactory receptors: Behavior, physiology and structure.

0,Risk of Distant Metastasis in Parathyroid Carcinoma and Its Effect on Survival: A Retrospective Review from a High-Volume Center,"Background: Development of distant metastases (DM) is associated with markedly decreased survival in parathyroid carcinoma (PC). We sought to identify factors associated with development of DM and to quantify the effect that development of DM had on overall survival (OS). Methods: Patients with surgically resected local/regional PC treated or surveilled at a tertiary-referral cancer hospital from 1980 to 2017 were included. We assessed the association between biochemical and clinicopathologic factors (preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, sex, race, age, preoperative serum calcium levels, serum calcium levels at 6Â months postop, tumor size, and extent of resection) with the development of DM. We also assessed the effect of development of DM on OS. Results: Seventy-five patients with PC were assessed; 17 (22.7%) developed DM at a median follow-up of 77Â months. The cumulative incidence of DM in the cohort was 20, 30, and 38% at 5, 10, and 20Â years respectively. Tumor size > 3.2Â cm based on recursive partitioning analysis was the only significant predictor for development of DM (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04â€“11.91; p = 0.04). Median OS for the entire cohort was 17Â years compared with 40Â months for the cohort who developed DM. The HR for death after distant metastasis was 9.6 (95% CI 4.2â€“22.3; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Development of distant metastasis during surveillance is associated with decreased OS, including late recurrences. Primary tumor size should be considered in future interval surveillance and development of treatment algorithms.","Risk of Distant Metastasis in Parathyroid Carcinoma and Its Effect on Survival: A Retrospective Review from a High-Volume Center.

1,Using a Deep Learning Algorithm and Integrated Gradients Explanation to Assist Grading for Diabetic Retinopathy,"PURPOSE: To understand the impact of deep learning diabetic retinopathy (DR) algorithms on physician readers in computer-assisted settings. DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic technology. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred ninety-six retinal fundus images from 1612 diabetic patients. METHODS: Ten ophthalmologists (5 general ophthalmologists, 4 retina specialists, 1 retina fellow) read images for DR severity based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy disease severity scale in each of 3 conditions: unassisted, grades only, or grades plus heatmap. Grades-only assistance comprised a histogram of DR predictions (grades) from a trained deep-learning model. For grades plus heatmap, we additionally showed explanatory heatmaps. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each experiment arm, we computed sensitivity and specificity of each reader and the algorithm for different levels of DR severity against an adjudicated reference standard. We also measured accuracy (exact 5-class level agreement and Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa), reader-reported confidence (5-point Likert scale), and grading time. RESULTS: Readers graded more accurately with model assistance than without for the grades-only condition (P < 0.001). Grades plus heatmaps improved accuracy for patients with DR (P < 0.001), but reduced accuracy for patients without DR (P = 0.006). Both forms of assistance increased readers' sensitivity moderate-or-worse DR: unassisted: mean, 79.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 72.3%-86.5%]; grades only: mean, 87.5% [95% CI, 85.1%-89.9%]; grades plus heatmap: mean, 88.7% [95% CI, 84.9%-92.5%] without a corresponding drop in specificity (unassisted: mean, 96.6% [95% CI, 95.9%-97.4%]; grades only: mean, 96.1% [95% CI, 95.5%-96.7%]; grades plus heatmap: mean, 95.5% [95% CI, 94.8%-96.1%]). Algorithmic assistance increased the accuracy of retina specialists above that of the unassisted reader or model alone; and increased grading confidence and grading time across all readers. For most cases, grades plus heatmap was only as effective as grades only. Over the course of the experiment, grading time decreased across all conditions, although most sharply for grades plus heatmap. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of, and confidence in, DR diagnosis in an assisted read setting. They also may increase grading time, although these effects may be ameliorated with experience.","Using a Deep Learning Algorithm and Integrated Gradients Explanation to Assist Grading for Diabetic Retinopathy.

1,Utility of machine learning algorithms in assessing patients with a systemic right ventricle,"To investigate the utility of novel deep learning (DL) algorithms in recognizing transposition of the great arteries (TGA) after atrial switch procedure or congenitally corrected TGA (ccTGA) based on routine transthoracic echocardiograms. In addition, the ability of DL algorithms for delineation and segmentation of the systemic ventricle was evaluated. Methods and results: In total, 132 patients (92 TGA and atrial switch and 40 with ccTGA; 60% male, age 38.3 Â± 12.1 years) and 67 normal controls (57% male, age 48.5 Â± 17.9 years) with routine transthoracic examinations were included. Convolutional neural networks were trained to classify patients by underlying diagnosis and a U-Net design was used to automatically segment the systemic ventricle. Convolutional networks were build based on over 100 000 frames of an apical four-chamber or parasternal short-axis view to detect underlying diagnoses. The DL algorithm had an overall accuracy of 98.0% in detecting the correct diagnosis. The U-Net architecture model correctly identified the systemic ventricle in all individuals and achieved a high performance in segmenting the systemic right or left ventricle (Dice metric between 0.79 and 0.88 depending on diagnosis) when compared with human experts. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms, trained on routine echocardiographic datasets to detect underlying diagnosis in complex congenital heart disease. Automated delineation of the ventricular area was also feasible. These methods may in future allow for the longitudinal, objective, and automated assessment of ventricular function.","Utility of machine learning algorithms in assessing patients with a systemic right ventricle.

1,A graph-based lesion characterization and deep embedding approach for improved computer-aided diagnosis of nonmass breast MRI lesions,"Nonmass-like enhancements are a common but diagnostically challenging finding in breast MRI. Nonmass-like lesions can be described as clusters of spatially and temporally inter-connected regions of enhancements, so they can be modeled as networks and their properties characterized via network-based connectivity. In this work, we represented nonmass lesions as graphs using a link formation energy model that favors linkages between regions of similar enhancement and closer spatial proximity. However, adding graph features to an existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) pipeline incurs an increase of feature space dimensionality, which poses additional challenges to traditional supervised machine learning techniques due to the inability to increase accordingly the number of training datasets. We propose the combination of unsupervised dimensionality reduction and embedded space clustering followed by a supervised classifier to improve the performance of a CAD system for nonmass-like lesions in breast MRI. Our work extends a previoulsy proposed framework for deep embedded unsupervised clustering (DEC) to embedding space classification, with the joint optimization of objective functions for DEC and supervised multi-layered perceptron (MLP) classification. The strength of the method lies in the ability to learn and further optimize an embedded feature representation of lower dimensionality that maximizes the diagnostic accuracy of a CAD lesion classifier to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. We identified 792 nonmass-like enhancements (267 benign, 110 malignant and 415 unknown) in 411 patients undergoing breast MRI at our institution. The diagnostic performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared to the performance of a conventional supervised MLP classifier in original feature space. A statistically significant increase in diagnostic area under the ROC curve (AUC) was achieved. Generalization AUC increased from 0.67+/-0.08 to 0.81+/-0.10 (21% increase, p-value=4.2x10(-8)) with the proposed graph-based lesion characterization and deep embedding framework.","A graph-based lesion characterization and deep embedding approach for improved computer-aided diagnosis of nonmass breast MRI lesions.

1,Integrated phosphoproteomics and transcriptional classifiers reveal hidden RAS signaling dynamics in multiple myeloma,"A major driver of multiple myeloma (MM) is thought to be aberrant signaling, yet no kinase inhibitors have proven successful in the clinic. Here, we employed an integrated, systems approach combining phosphoproteomic and transcriptome analysis to dissect cellular signaling in MM to inform precision medicine strategies. Unbiased phosphoproteomics initially revealed differential activation of kinases across MM cell lines and that sensitivity to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition may be particularly dependent on mTOR kinase baseline activity. We further noted differential activity of immediate downstream effectors of Ras as a function of cell line genotype. We extended these observations to patient transcriptome data in the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study. A machine-learningâ€“based classifier identified surprisingly divergent transcriptional outputs between NRAS- and KRAS-mutated tumors. Genetic dependency and gene expression analysis revealed mutated Ras as a selective vulnerability, but not other MAPK pathway genes. Transcriptional analysis further suggested that aberrant MAPK pathway activation is only present in a fraction of RAS-mutated vs wild-type RAS patients. These high-MAPK patients, enriched for NRAS Q61 mutations, have inferior outcomes, whereas RAS mutations overall carry no survival impact. We further developed an interactive software tool to relate pharmacologic and genetic kinase dependencies in myeloma. Collectively, these predictive models identify vulnerable signaling signatures and highlight surprising differences in functional signaling patterns between NRAS and KRAS mutants invisible to the genomic landscape. These results will lead to improved stratification of MM patients in precision medicine trials while also revealing unexplored modes of Ras biology in MM.","Integrated phosphoproteomics and transcriptional classifiers reveal hidden RAS signaling dynamics in multiple myeloma.

1,Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Geolocation-Centric Monitoring and Characterization of Opioid-Related Social Media Chatter,"Importance: Automatic curation of consumer-generated, opioid-related social media big data may enable real-time monitoring of the opioid epidemic in the United States. Objective: To develop and validate an automatic text-processing pipeline for geospatial and temporal analysis of opioid-mentioning social media chatter. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted from December 1, 2017, to August 31, 2019, and used more than 3 years of publicly available social media posts on Twitter, dated from January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2015, that were geolocated in Pennsylvania. Opioid-mentioning tweets were extracted using prescription and illicit opioid names, including street names and misspellings. Social media posts (tweets) (n = 9006) were manually categorized into 4 classes, and training and evaluation of several machine learning algorithms were performed. Temporal and geospatial patterns were analyzed with the best-performing classifier on unlabeled data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pearson and Spearman correlations of county- and substate-level abuse-indicating tweet rates with opioid overdose death rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database and with 4 metrics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 3 years were calculated. Classifier performances were measured through microaveraged F1 scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall) or accuracies and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 9006 social media posts were annotated, of which 1748 (19.4%) were related to abuse, 2001 (22.2%) were related to information, 4830 (53.6%) were unrelated, and 427 (4.7%) were not in the English language. Yearly rates of abuse-indicating social media post showed statistically significant correlation with county-level opioid-related overdose death rates (n = 75) for 3 years (Pearson r = 0.451, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.331, P =.004). Abuse-indicating tweet rates showed consistent correlations with 4 NSDUH metrics (n = 13) associated with nonmedical prescription opioid use (Pearson r = 0.683, P =.01; Spearman r = 0.346, P =.25), illicit drug use (Pearson r = 0.850, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.341, P =.25), illicit drug dependence (Pearson r = 0.937, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.495, P =.09), and illicit drug dependence or abuse (Pearson r = 0.935, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.401, P =.17) over the same 3-year period, although the tests lacked power to demonstrate statistical significance. A classification approach involving an ensemble of classifiers produced the best performance in accuracy or microaveraged F1 score (0.726; 95% CI, 0.708-0.743). Conclusions and Relevance: The correlations obtained in this study suggest that a social media-based approach reliant on supervised machine learning may be suitable for geolocation-centric monitoring of the US opioid epidemic in near real time.","Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Geolocation-Centric Monitoring and Characterization of Opioid-Related Social Media Chatter.

1,Understanding the importance of key risk factors in predicting chronic bronchitic symptoms using a machine learning approach,"BACKGROUND: Chronic respiratory symptoms involving bronchitis, cough and phlegm in children are underappreciated but pose a significant public health burden. Efforts for prevention and management could be supported by an understanding of the relative importance of determinants, including environmental exposures. Thus, we aim to develop a prediction model for bronchitic symptoms. METHODS: Schoolchildren from the population-based southern California Children's Health Study were visited annually from 2003 to 2012. Bronchitic symptoms over the prior 12â€‰months were assessed by questionnaire. A gradient boosting model was fit using groups of risk factors (including traffic/air pollution exposures) for all children and by asthma status. Training data consisted of one observation per participant in a random study year (for 50% of participants). Validation data consisted of: (1) a random (later) year in the same participants (within-participant); (2) a random year in participants excluded from the training data (across-participant). RESULTS: At baseline, 13.2% of children had asthma and 18.1% reported bronchitic symptoms. Models performed similarly within- and across-participant. Previous year symptoms/medication use provided much of the predictive ability (across-participant area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.76 vs 0.78 for all risk factors, in all participants). Traffic/air pollution exposures added modestly to prediction as did body mass index percentile, age and parent stress. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of asthma status, previous symptoms were the most important predictors of current symptoms. Traffic/air pollution variables contribute modest predictive information, but impact large populations. Methods proposed here could be generalized to personalized exacerbation predictions in future longitudinal studies to support targeted prevention efforts.","Understanding the importance of key risk factors in predicting chronic bronchitic symptoms using a machine learning approach.

1,"Variation in Follow-up Imaging Recommendations in Radiology Reports: Patient, Modality, and Radiologist Predictors","Background Variation between radiologists when making recommendations for additional imaging and associated factors are, to the knowledge of the authors, unknown. Clear identification of factors that account for variation in follow-up recommendations might prevent unnecessary tests for incidental or ambiguous image findings. Purpose To determine incidence and identify factors associated with follow-up recommendations in radiology reports from multiple modalities, patient care settings, and imaging divisions. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed 318 366 reports obtained from diagnostic imaging examinations performed at a large urban quaternary care hospital from January 1 to December 31, 2016, excluding breast and US reports. A subset of 1000 reports were randomly selected and manually annotated to train and validate a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a report included a follow-up imaging recommendation (training-and-validation set consisted of 850 reports and test set of 150 reports). The trained algorithm was used to classify 318 366 reports. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of follow-up recommendation. Additional analysis by imaging subspecialty division was performed, and intradivision and interradiologist variability was quantified. Results The machine learning algorithm classified 38 745 of 318 366 (12.2%) reports as containing follow-up recommendations. Average patient age was 59 years +/- 17 (standard deviation); 45.2% (143 767 of 318 366) of reports were from male patients. Among 65 radiologists, 57% (37 of 65) were men. At multivariable analysis, older patients had higher rates of follow-up recommendations (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.01, 1.01] for each additional year), male patients had lower rates of follow-up recommendations (OR, 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.0), and follow-up recommendations were most common among CT studies (OR, 4.2 [95% CI: 4.0, 4.4] compared with radiography). Radiologist sex (P = .54), presence of a trainee (P = .45), and years in practice (P = .49) were not significant predictors overall. A division-level analysis showed 2.8-fold to 6.7-fold interradiologist variation. Conclusion Substantial interradiologist variation exists in the probability of recommending a follow-up examination in a radiology report, after adjusting for patient, examination, and radiologist factors.

1,Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study,"BACKGROUND: For most computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) problems involving prostate cancer detection via medical imaging data, the choice of classifier has been largely ad hoc, or been motivated by classifier comparison studies that have involved large synthetic datasets. More significantly, it is currently unknown how classifier choices and trends generalize across multiple institutions, due to heterogeneous acquisition and intensity characteristics (especially when considering MR imaging data). In this work, we empirically evaluate and compare a number of different classifiers and classifier ensembles in a multi-site setting, for voxel-wise detection of prostate cancer (PCa) using radiomic texture features derived from high-resolution in vivo T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. METHODS: Twelve different supervised classifier schemes: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), naÃ¯ve Bayes, Decision Trees (DTs), and their ensemble variants (bagging, boosting), were compared in terms of classification accuracy as well as execution time. Our study utilized 85 prostate cancer T2w MRI datasets acquired from across 3 different institutions (1 for discovery, 2 for independent validation), from patients who later underwent radical prostatectomy. Surrogate ground truth for disease extent on MRI was established by expert annotation of pre-operative MRI through spatial correlation with corresponding ex vivo whole-mount histology sections. Classifier accuracy in detecting PCa extent on MRI on a per-voxel basis was evaluated via area under the ROC curve. RESULTS: The boosted DT classifier yielded the highest cross-validated AUC (= 0.744) for detecting PCa in the discovery cohort. However, in independent validation, the boosted QDA classifier was identified as the most accurate and robust for voxel-wise detection of PCa extent (AUCs of 0.735, 0.683, 0.768 across the 3 sites). The next most accurate and robust classifier was the single QDA classifier, which also enjoyed the advantage of significantly lower computation times compared to any of the other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that simpler classifiers (such as QDA and its ensemble variants) may be more robust, accurate, and efficient for prostate cancer CAD problems, especially in the context of multi-site validation.","Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study.

1,Development and Performance of the Pulmonary Embolism Result Forecast Model (PERFORM) for Computed Tomography Clinical Decision Support,"Importance: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening clinical problem, and computed tomographic imaging is the standard for diagnosis. Clinical decision support rules based on PE risk-scoring models have been developed to compute pretest probability but are underused and tend to underperform in practice, leading to persistent overuse of CT imaging for PE. Objective: To develop a machine learning model to generate a patient-specific risk score for PE by analyzing longitudinal clinical data as clinical decision support for patients referred for CT imaging for PE. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, the proposed workflow for the machine learning model, the Pulmonary Embolism Result Forecast Model (PERFORM), transforms raw electronic medical record (EMR) data into temporal feature vectors and develops a decision analytical model targeted toward adult patients referred for CT imaging for PE. The model was tested on holdout patient EMR data from 2 large, academic medical practices. A total of 3397 annotated CT imaging examinations for PE from 3214 unique patients seen at Stanford University hospitals and clinics were used for training and validation. The models were externally validated on 240 unique patients seen at Duke University Medical Center. The comparison with clinical scoring systems was done on randomly selected 100 outpatient samples from Stanford University hospitals and clinics and 101 outpatient samples from Duke University Medical Center. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prediction performance of diagnosing acute PE was evaluated using ElasticNet, artificial neural networks, and other machine learning approaches on holdout data sets from both institutions, and performance of models was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: Of the 3214 patients included in the study, 1704 (53.0%) were women from Stanford University hospitals and clinics; mean (SD) age was 60.53 (19.43) years. The 240 patients from Duke University Medical Center used for validation included 132 women (55.0%); mean (SD) age was 70.2 (14.2) years. In the samples for clinical scoring system comparisons, the 100 outpatients from Stanford University hospitals and clinics included 67 women (67.0%); mean (SD) age was 57.74 (19.87) years, and the 101 patients from Duke University Medical Center included 59 women (58.4%); mean (SD) age was 73.06 (15.3) years. The best-performing model achieved an AUROC performance of predicting a positive PE study of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.91) on intrainstitutional holdout data with an AUROC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.72) on an external data set from Duke University Medical Center; superior AUROC performance and cross-institutional generalization of the model of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.87) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.82), respectively, were noted on holdout outpatient populations from both intrainstitutional and extrainstitutional data. Conclusions and Relevance: The machine learning model, PERFORM, may consider multitudes of applicable patient-specific risk factors and dependencies to arrive at a PE risk prediction that generalizes to new population distributions. This approach might be used as an automated clinical decision-support tool for patients referred for CT PE imaging to improve CT use.","Development and Performance of the Pulmonary Embolism Result Forecast Model (PERFORM) for Computed Tomography Clinical Decision Support.

1,A user interface for optimizing radiologist engagement in image data curation for artificial intelligence,"Purpose: To delineate image data curation needs and describe a locally designed graphical user interface (GUI) to aid radiologists in image annotation for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging. Materials and Methods: GUI components support image analysis toolboxes, picture archiving and communication system integration, third-party applications, processing of scripting languages, and integration of deep learning libraries. For clinical AI applications, GUI components included two-dimensional segmentation and classification; three-dimensional segmentation and quantification; and threedimensional segmentation, quantification, and classification. To assess radiologist engagement and performance efficiency associated with GUI-related capabilities, image annotation rate (studies per day) and speed (minutes per case) were evaluated in two clinical scenarios of varying complexity: Hip fracture detection and coronary atherosclerotic plaque demarcation and stenosis grading. Results: For hip fracture, 1050 radiographs were annotated over 7 days (150 studies per day; median speed: 10 seconds per study [interquartile range, 3-21 seconds per study]). A total of 294 coronary CT angiographic studies with 1843 arteries and branches were annotated for atherosclerotic plaque over 23 days (15.2 studies [80.1 vessels] per day; median speed: 6.08 minutes per study [interquartile range, 2.8-10.6 minutes per study] and 73 seconds per vessel [interquartile range, 20.9-155 seconds per vessel]). Conclusion: GUI-component compatibility with common image analysis tools facilitates radiologist engagement in image data curation, including image annotation, supporting AI application development and evolution for medical imaging. When complemented by other GUI elements, a continuous integrated workflow supporting formation of an agile deep neural network life cycle results.","A user interface for optimizing radiologist engagement in image data curation for artificial intelligence.

1,An automated machine learning-based model predicts postoperative mortality using readily-extractable preoperative electronic health record data,"BACKGROUND: Rapid, preoperative identification of patients with the highest risk for medical complications is necessary to ensure that limited infrastructure and human resources are directed towards those most likely to benefit. Existing risk scores either lack specificity at the patient level or utilise the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, which requires a clinician to review the chart. METHODS: We report on the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically random forests, to create a fully automated score that predicts postoperative in-hospital mortality based solely on structured data available at the time of surgery. Electronic health record data from 53 097 surgical patients (2.01% mortality rate) who underwent general anaesthesia between April 1, 2013 and December 10, 2018 in a large US academic medical centre were used to extract 58 preoperative features. RESULTS: Using a random forest classifier we found that automatically obtained preoperative features (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.932, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.910-0.951) outperforms Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM) scores (AUC of 0.660, 95% CI 0.598-0.722), Charlson comorbidity scores (AUC of 0.742, 95% CI 0.658-0.812), and ASA physical status (AUC of 0.866, 95% CI 0.829-0.897). Including the ASA physical status with the preoperative features achieves an AUC of 0.936 (95% CI 0.917-0.955). CONCLUSIONS: This automated score outperforms the ASA physical status score, the Charlson comorbidity score, and the POSPOM score for predicting in-hospital mortality. Additionally, we integrate this score with a previously published postoperative score to demonstrate the extent to which patient risk changes during the perioperative period.","An automated machine learning-based model predicts postoperative mortality using readily-extractable preoperative electronic health record data.

1,Natural language processing of radiology reports for identification of skeletal site-specific fractures,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis has become an important public health issue. Most of the population, particularly elderly people, are at some degree of risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. Accurate identification and surveillance of patient populations with fractures has a significant impact on reduction of cost of care by preventing future fractures and its corresponding complications. METHODS: In this study, we developed a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for identification of twenty skeletal site-specific fractures from radiology reports. The rule-based NLP algorithm was based on regular expressions developed using MedTagger, an NLP tool of the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) pipeline to facilitate information extraction from clinical narratives. Radiology notes were retrieved from the Mayo Clinic electronic health records data warehouse. We developed rules for identifying each fracture type according to physicians' knowledge and experience, and refined these rules via verification with physicians. This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) for human subject research. RESULTS: We validated the NLP algorithm using the radiology reports of a community-based cohort at Mayo Clinic with the gold standard constructed by medical experts. The micro-averaged results of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score of the proposed NLP algorithm are 0.930, 1.0, 1.0, 0.941, 0.961, respectively. The F1-score is 1.0 for 8 fractures, and above 0.9 for a total of 17 out of 20 fractures (85%). CONCLUSIONS: The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed rule-based NLP algorithm in automatic identification of osteoporosis-related skeletal site-specific fractures from radiology reports. The NLP algorithm could be utilized to accurately identify the patients with fractures and those who are also at high risk of future fractures due to osteoporosis. Appropriate care interventions to those patients, not only the most at-risk patients but also those with emerging risk, would significantly reduce future fractures.","Natural language processing of radiology reports for identification of skeletal site-specific fractures.

1,Identifying Smoking Environments from Images of Daily Life with Deep Learning,"Importance: Environments associated with smoking increase a smoker's craving to smoke and may provoke lapses during a quit attempt. Identifying smoking risk environments from images of a smoker's daily life provides a basis for environment-based interventions. Objective: To apply a deep learning approach to the clinically relevant identification of smoking environments among settings that smokers encounter in daily life. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, 4902 images of smoking (n = 2457) and nonsmoking (n = 2445) locations were photographed by 169 smokers from Durham, North Carolina, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, areas from 2010 to 2016. These images were used to develop a probabilistic classifier to predict the location type (smoking or nonsmoking location), thus relating objects and settings in daily environments to established smoking patterns. The classifier combines a deep convolutional neural network with an interpretable logistic regression model and was trained and evaluated via nested cross-validation with participant-wise partitions (ie, out-of-sample prediction). To contextualize model performance, images taken by 25 randomly selected participants were also classified by smoking cessation experts. As secondary validation, craving levels reported by participants when viewing unfamiliar environments were compared with the model's predictions. Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Classifier performance (accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), comparison with 4 smoking cessation experts, contribution of objects and settings to smoking environment status (standardized model coefficients), and correlation with participant-reported craving. Results: Of 169 participants, 106 (62.7%) were from Durham (53 [50.0%] female; mean [SD] age, 41.4 [12.0] years) and 63 (37.3%) were from Pittsburgh (31 [51.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 35.2 [13.8] years). A total of 4902 images were available for analysis, including 3386 from Durham (mean [SD], 31.9 [1.3] images per participant) and 1516 from Pittsburgh (mean [SD], 24.1 [0.5] images per participant). Images were evenly split between the 2 classes, with 2457 smoking images (50.1%) and 2445 nonsmoking images (49.9%). The final model discriminated smoking vs nonsmoking environments with a mean (SD) AUC of 0.840 (0.024) (accuracy [SD], 76.5% [1.6%]). A model trained only with images from Durham participants effectively classified images from Pittsburgh participants (AUC, 0.757; accuracy, 69.2%), and a model trained only with images from Pittsburgh participants effectively classified images from Durham participants (AUC, 0.821; accuracy, 75.0%), suggesting good generalizability between geographic areas. Only 1 expert's performance was a statistically significant improvement compared with the classifier (Î¼ =.05). Median self-reported craving was significantly correlated with model-predicted smoking environment status (Ï = 0.894; P =.003). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, features of daily environments predicted smoking vs nonsmoking status consistently across participants. The findings suggest that a deep learning approach can identify environments associated with smoking, can predict the probability that any image of daily life represents a smoking environment, and can potentially trigger environment-based interventions. This work demonstrates a framework for predicting how daily environments may influence target behaviors or symptoms that may have broad applications in mental and physical health..","Identifying Smoking Environments from Images of Daily Life with Deep Learning.

1,Estimating cholera incidence with cross-sectional serology,"The development of new approaches to cholera control relies on an accurate understanding of cholera epidemiology. However, most information on cholera incidence lacks laboratory confirmation and instead relies on surveillance systems reporting medically attended acute watery diarrhea. If recent infections could be identified using serological markers, cross-sectional serosurveys would offer an alternative approach to measuring incidence. Here, we used 1569 serologic samples from a cohort of cholera cases and their uninfected contacts in Bangladesh to train machine learning models to identify recent Vibrio cholerae O1 infections. We found that an individual's antibody profile contains information on the timing of V. cholerae O1 infections in the previous year. Our models using six serological markers accurately identified individuals in the Bangladesh cohort infected within the last year [cross-validated area under the curve (AUC), 93.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 92.1 to 94.7%], with a marginal performance decrease using models based on two markers (cross-validated AUC, 91.0%; 95% CI, 89.2 to 92.7%). We validated the performance of the two-marker model on data from a cohort of North American volunteers challenged with V. cholerae O1 (AUC range, 88.4 to 98.4%). In simulated serosurveys, our models accurately estimated annual incidence in both endemic and epidemic settings, even with sample sizes as small as 500 and annual incidence as low as two infections per 1000 individuals. Cross-sectional serosurveys may be a viable approach to estimating cholera incidence.","Estimating cholera incidence with cross-sectional serology.

1,Clinicopathological Features of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Epigenetic Subtypes,"Background/Objective: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous collection of breast tumors with numerous differences including morphological characteristics, genetic makeup, immune-cell infiltration, and response to systemic therapy. DNA methylation profiling is a robust tool to accurately identify disease-specific subtypes. We aimed to generate an epigenetic subclassification of TNBC tumors (epitypes) with utility for clinical decision-making. Methods: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from TNBC patients generated in the Cancer Genome Atlas project were used to build machine learning-based epigenetic classifiers. Clinical and demographic variables, as well as gene expression and gene mutation data from the same cohort, were integrated to further refine the TNBC epitypes. Results: This analysis indicated the existence of four TNBC epitypes, named as Epi-CL-A, Epi-CL-B, Epi-CL-C, and Epi-CL-D. Patients with Epi-CL-B tumors showed significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival [log rank; P = 0.01; hazard ratio (HR) 3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3â€“11.63 and P = 0.003; HR 5.29, 95% CI 1.55â€“18.18, respectively]. Significant gene expression and mutation differences among the TNBC epitypes suggested alternative pathway activation that could be used as ancillary therapeutic targets. These epigenetic subtypes showed complementarity with the recently described TNBC transcriptomic subtypes. Conclusions: TNBC epigenetic subtypes exhibit significant clinical and molecular differences. The links between genetic make-up, gene expression programs, and epigenetic subtypes open new avenues in the development of laboratory tests to more efficiently stratify TNBC patients, helping optimize tailored treatment approaches.","Clinicopathological Features of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Epigenetic Subtypes.

1,PV-LVNet: Direct left ventricle multitype indices estimation from 2D echocardiograms of paired apical views with deep neural networks,"Accurate direct estimation of the left ventricle (LV) multitype indices from two-dimensional (2D) echocardiograms of paired apical views, i.e., paired apical four-chamber (A4C) and two-chamber (A2C), is of great significance to clinically evaluate cardiac function. It enables a comprehensive assessment from multiple dimensions and views. Yet it is extremely challenging and has never been attempted, due to significantly varied LV shape and appearance across subjects and along cardiac cycle, the complexity brought by the paired different views, unexploited inter-frame indices relatedness hampering working effect, and low image quality preventing segmentation. We propose a paired-views LV network (PV-LVNet) to automatically and directly estimate LV multitype indices from paired echo apical views. Based on a newly designed Res-circle Net, the PV-LVNet robustly locates LV and automatically crops LV region of interest from A4C and A2C sequence with location module and image resampling, then accurately and consistently estimates 7 different indices of multiple dimensions (1D, 2D & 3D) and views (A2C, A4C, and union of A2C+A4C) with indices module. The experiments show that our method achieves high performance with accuracy up to 2.85mm mean absolute error and internal consistency up to 0.974 Cronbach's alpha for the cardiac indices estimation. All of these indicate that our method enables an efficient, accurate and reliable cardiac function diagnosis in clinical.","PV-LVNet: Direct left ventricle multitype indices estimation from 2D echocardiograms of paired apical views with deep neural networks.

1,"Clinical risk prediction with random forests for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (RF-SLAM) data analysis","BACKGROUND: Clinical research and medical practice can be advanced through the prediction of an individual's health state, trajectory, and responses to treatments. However, the majority of current clinical risk prediction models are based on regression approaches or machine learning algorithms that are static, rather than dynamic. To benefit from the increasing emergence of large, heterogeneous data sets, such as electronic health records (EHRs), novel tools to support improved clinical decision making through methods for individual-level risk prediction that can handle multiple variables, their interactions, and time-varying values are necessary. METHODS: We introduce a novel dynamic approach to clinical risk prediction for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcomes, called random forest for SLAM data analysis (RF-SLAM). RF-SLAM is a continuous-time, random forest method for survival analysis that combines the strengths of existing statistical and machine learning methods to produce individualized Bayes estimates of piecewise-constant hazard rates. We also present a method-agnostic approach for time-varying evaluation of model performance. RESULTS: We derive and illustrate the method by predicting sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the Left Ventricular Structural (LV) Predictors of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Registry. We demonstrate superior performance relative to standard random forest methods for survival data. We illustrate the importance of the number of preceding heart failure hospitalizations as a time-dependent predictor in SCA risk assessment. CONCLUSIONS: RF-SLAM is a novel statistical and machine learning method that improves risk prediction by incorporating time-varying information and accommodating a large number of predictors, their interactions, and missing values. RF-SLAM is designed to easily extend to simultaneous predictions of multiple, possibly competing, events and/or repeated measurements of discrete or continuous variables over time.

1,Altered urinary amino acids in children with autism spectrum disorders,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect 1% of children. Although there is no cure, early diagnosis and behavioral intervention can relieve the symptoms. The clinical heterogeneity of ASD has created a need for improved sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostic methods. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based analysis of the metabolome has shown great potential to uncover biomarkers for complex diseases such as ASD. Here, we used a two-step discoveryâ€“validation approach to identify potential novel metabolic biomarkers for ASD. Urine samples from 57 children with ASD and 81 matched children with typical development (TD) were analyzed by LS-MS/MS to assess differences in urinary amino acids and their metabolites (referred to as UAA indicators). A total of 63 UAA indicators were identified, of which 21 were present at significantly different levels in the urine of ASD children compared with TD children. Of these 21, the concentrations of 19 and 10 were higher and lower, respectively, in the urine of ASD children compared with TD children. Using support vector machine modeling and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, we identified a panel of 7 UAA indicators that discriminated between the samples from ASD and TD children (lysine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 5-hydroxytryptamine, proline, aspartate, arginine/ornithine, and 4-hydroxyproline). Among the significantly changed pathways in ASD children were the ornithine/urea cycle (decreased levels of the excitatory amino acid aspartate [p = 2.15 Ã— 10âˆ’10] and increased arginine/ornithine [p = 5.21 Ã— 10âˆ’9]), tryptophan metabolism (increased levels of inhibitory 5-hydroxytryptamine p = 3.62 Ã— 10âˆ’9), the methionine cycle (increased methionine sulfoxide [p = 1.46 Ã— 10âˆ’10] and decreased homocysteine [p = 2.73 Ã— 10âˆ’7]), and lysine metabolism (reduced lysine [p = 7.8 Ã— 10âˆ’9 ], Î±-aminoadipic acid [p = 1.16 Ã— 10âˆ’9], and 5-aminovaleric acid [p = 1.05 Ã— 10âˆ’5]). Collectively, the data presented here identify a possible imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory amino acid metabolism in ASD children. The significantly altered UAA indicators could therefore be potential diagnostic biomarkers for ASD.","Altered urinary amino acids in children with autism spectrum disorders.

1,Evaluation of algorithms for Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation: An open-access grand challenge,"Knowledge of whole heart anatomy is a prerequisite for many clinical applications. Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of the heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be challenging due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of the clinical data. To achieve this goal, an initial set of training data is generally needed for constructing priors or for training. Furthermore, it is difficult to perform comparisons between different methods, largely due to differences in the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents the methodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the submissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provided 120 three-dimensional cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes, all acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms for CT data and eleven algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups, have been evaluated. The results showed that the performance of CT WHS was generally better than that of MRI WHS. The segmentation of the substructures for different categories of patients could present different levels of challenge due to the difference in imaging and variations of heart shapes. The deep learning (DL)-based methods demonstrated great potential, though several of them reported poor results in the blinded evaluation. Their performance could vary greatly across different network structures and training strategies. The conventional algorithms, mainly based on multi-atlas segmentation, demonstrated good performance, though the accuracy and computational efficiency could be limited. The challenge, including provision of the annotated training data and the blinded evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test data, continues as an ongoing benchmarking resource via its homepage (www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/).","Evaluation of algorithms for Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation: An open-access grand challenge.

1,Task representations in neural networks trained to perform many cognitive tasks,"The brain has the ability to flexibly perform many tasks, but the underlying mechanism cannot be elucidated in traditional experimental and modeling studies designed for one task at a time. Here, we trained single network models to perform 20 cognitive tasks that depend on working memory, decision making, categorization, and inhibitory control. We found that after training, recurrent units can develop into clusters that are functionally specialized for different cognitive processes, and we introduce a simple yet effective measure to quantify relationships between single-unit neural representations of tasks. Learning often gives rise to compositionality of task representations, a critical feature for cognitive flexibility, whereby one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks. Finally, networks developed mixed task selectivity similar to recorded prefrontal neurons after learning multiple tasks sequentially with a continual-learning technique.

The brain has the ability to flexibly perform many tasks, but the underlying mechanism cannot be elucidated in traditional experimental and modeling studies designed for one task at a time. Here, we trained single network models to perform 20 cognitive tasks that depend on working memory, decision making, categorization, and inhibitory control.

1,Iterative fully convolutional neural networks for automatic vertebra segmentation and identification,"Precise segmentation and anatomical identification of the vertebrae provides the basis for automatic analysis of the spine, such as detection of vertebral compression fractures or other abnormalities. Most dedicated spine CT and MR scans as well as scans of the chest, abdomen or neck cover only part of the spine. Segmentation and identification should therefore not rely on the visibility of certain vertebrae or a certain number of vertebrae. We propose an iterative instance segmentation approach that uses a fully convolutional neural network to segment and label vertebrae one after the other, independently of the number of visible vertebrae. This instance-by-instance segmentation is enabled by combining the network with a memory component that retains information about already segmented vertebrae. The network iteratively analyzes image patches, using information from both image and memory to search for the next vertebra. To efficiently traverse the image, we include the prior knowledge that the vertebrae are always located next to each other, which is used to follow the vertebral column. The network concurrently performs multiple tasks, which are segmentation of a vertebra, regression of its anatomical label and prediction whether the vertebra is completely visible in the image, which allows to exclude incompletely visible vertebrae from further analyses. The predicted anatomical labels of the individual vertebrae are additionally refined with a maximum likelihood approach, choosing the overall most likely labeling if all detected vertebrae are taken into account. This method was evaluated with five diverse datasets, including multiple modalities (CT and MR), various fields of view and coverages of different sections of the spine, and a particularly challenging set of low-dose chest CT scans. For vertebra segmentation, the average Dice score was 94.9+/-2.1% with an average absolute symmetric surface distance of 0.2+/-10.1mm. The anatomical identification had an accuracy of 93%, corresponding to a single case with mislabeled vertebrae. Vertebrae were classified as completely or incompletely visible with an accuracy of 97%. The proposed iterative segmentation method compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods and is fast, flexible and generalizable.","Iterative fully convolutional neural networks for automatic vertebra segmentation and identification.

1,Development and Validation of a Deep Learning System to Detect Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy Using Fundus Photographs,"Importance: A deep learning system (DLS) that could automatically detect glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) with high sensitivity and specificity could expedite screening for GON. Objective: To establish a DLS for detection of GON using retinal fundus images and glaucoma diagnosis with convoluted neural networks (GD-CNN) that has the ability to be generalized across populations. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, a DLS for the classification of GON was developed for automated classification of GON using retinal fundus images obtained from the Chinese Glaucoma Study Alliance, the Handan Eye Study, and online databases. The researchers selected 241 032 images were selected as the training dataset. The images were entered into the databases on June 9, 2009, obtained on July 11, 2018, and analyses were performed on December 15, 2018. The generalization of the DLS was tested in several validation datasets, which allowed assessment of the DLS in a clinical setting without exclusions, testing against variable image quality based on fundus photographs obtained from websites, evaluation in a population-based study that reflects a natural distribution of patients with glaucoma within the cohort and an additive dataset that has a diverse ethnic distribution. An online learning system was established to transfer the trained and validated DLS to generalize the results with fundus images from new sources. To better understand the DLS decision-making process, a prediction visualization test was performed that identified regions of the fundus images utilized by the DLS for diagnosis. Exposures: Use of a deep learning system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for DLS with reference to professional graders. Results: From a total of 274 413 fundus images initially obtained from CGSA, 269 601 images passed initial image quality review and were graded for GON. A total of 241 032 images (definite GON 29 865 [12.4%], probable GON 11 046 [4.6%], unlikely GON 200 121 [83%]) from 68 013 patients were selected using random sampling to train the GD-CNN model. Validation and evaluation of the GD-CNN model was assessed using the remaining 28 569 images from CGSA. The AUC of the GD-CNN model in primary local validation datasets was 0.996 (95% CI, 0.995-0.998), with sensitivity of 96.2% and specificity of 97.7%. The most common reason for both false-negative and false-positive grading by GD-CNN (51 of 119 [46.3%] and 191 of 588 [32.3%]) and manual grading (50 of 113 [44.2%] and 183 of 538 [34.0%]) was pathologic or high myopia. Conclusions and Relevance: Application of GD-CNN to fundus images from different settings and varying image quality demonstrated a high sensitivity, specificity, and generalizability for detecting GON. These findings suggest that automated DLS could enhance current screening programs in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.","Development and Validation of a Deep Learning System to Detect Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy Using Fundus Photographs.

1,"Derivation, Validation, and Potential Treatment Implications of Novel Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis","Importance: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may allow more precise therapy and improve care. Objective: To derive sepsis phenotypes from clinical data, determine their reproducibility and correlation with host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and assess the potential causal relationship with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of data sets using statistical, machine learning, and simulation tools. Phenotypes were derived among 20189 total patients (16552 unique patients) who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of hospital presentation at 12 Pennsylvania hospitals (2010-2012) using consensus k means clustering applied to 29 variables. Reproducibility and correlation with biological parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed in a second database (2013-2014; n = 43086 total patients and n = 31160 unique patients), in a prospective cohort study of sepsis due to pneumonia (n = 583), and in 3 sepsis RCTs (n = 4737). Exposures: All clinical and laboratory variables in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures: Derived phenotype (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) frequency, host-response biomarkers, 28-day and 365-day mortality, and RCT simulation outputs. Results: The derivation cohort included 20189 patients with sepsis (mean age, 64 [SD, 17] years; 10022 [50%] male; mean maximum 24-hour Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, 3.9 [SD, 2.4]). The validation cohort included 43086 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 17] years; 21993 [51%] male; mean maximum 24-hour SOFA score, 3.6 [SD, 2.0]). Of the 4 derived phenotypes, the alpha phenotype was the most common (n = 6625; 33%) and included patients with the lowest administration of a vasopressor; in the beta phenotype (n = 5512; 27%), patients were older and had more chronic illness and renal dysfunction; in the gamma phenotype (n = 5385; 27%), patients had more inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction; and in the delta phenotype (n = 2667; 13%), patients had more liver dysfunction and septic shock. Phenotype distributions were similar in the validation cohort. There were consistent differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype. In the derivation cohort, cumulative 28-day mortality was 287 deaths of 5691 unique patients (5%) for the alpha phenotype; 561 of 4420 (13%) for the beta phenotype; 1031 of 4318 (24%) for the gamma phenotype; and 897 of 2223 (40%) for the delta phenotype. Across all cohorts and trials, 28-day and 365-day mortality were highest among the delta phenotype vs the other 3 phenotypes (P < .001). In simulation models, the proportion of RCTs reporting benefit, harm, or no effect changed considerably (eg, varying the phenotype frequencies within an RCT of early goal-directed therapy changed the results from >33% chance of benefit to >60% chance of harm). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective analysis of data sets from patients with sepsis, 4 clinical phenotypes were identified that correlated with host-response patterns and clinical outcomes, and simulations suggested these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity of treatment effects. Further research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical care and for informing trial design and interpretation.","Derivation, Validation, and Potential Treatment Implications of Novel Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis.

1,Gastroenterologist-Level Identification of Small-Bowel Diseases and Normal Variants by Capsule Endoscopy Using a Deep-Learning Model,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized investigation of the small bowel. However, this technique produces a video that is 8-10 hours long, so analysis is time consuming for gastroenterologists. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can recognize specific images among a large variety. We aimed to develop a CNN-based algorithm to assist in the evaluation of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SB-CE) images. METHODS: We collected 113,426,569 images from 6970 patients who had SB-CE at 77 medical centers from July 2016 through July 2018. A CNN-based auxiliary reading model was trained to differentiate abnormal from normal images using 158,235 SB-CE images from 1970 patients. Images were categorized as normal, inflammation, ulcer, polyps, lymphangiectasia, bleeding, vascular disease, protruding lesion, lymphatic follicular hyperplasia, diverticulum, parasite, and other. The model was further validated in 5000 patients (no patient was overlap with the 1970 patients in the training set); the same patients were evaluated by conventional analysis and CNN-based auxiliary analysis by 20 gastroenterologists. If there was agreement in image categorization between the conventional analysis and CNN model, no further evaluation was performed. If there was disagreement between the conventional analysis and CNN model, the gastroenterologists re-evaluated the image to confirm or reject the CNN categorization. RESULTS: In the SB-CE images from the validation set, 4206 abnormalities in 3280 patients were identified after final consensus evaluation. The CNN-based auxiliary model identified abnormalities with 99.88% sensitivity in the per-patient analysis (95% CI, 99.67-99.96) and 99.90% sensitivity in the per-lesion analysis (95% CI, 99.74-99.97). Conventional reading by the gastroenterologists identified abnormalities with 74.57% sensitivity (95% CI, 73.05-76.03) in the per-patient analysis and 76.89% in the per-lesion analysis (95% CI, 75.58-78.15). The mean reading time per patient was 96.6 +/- 22.53 minutes by conventional reading and 5.9 +/- 2.23 minutes by CNN-based auxiliary reading (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We validated the ability of a CNN-based algorithm to identify abnormalities in SB-CE images. The CNN-based auxiliary model identified abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity and significantly shorter reading times than conventional analysis by gastroenterologists. This algorithm provides an important tool to help gastroenterologists analyze SB-CE images more efficiently and more accurately.","Gastroenterologist-Level Identification of Small-Bowel Diseases and Normal Variants by Capsule Endoscopy Using a Deep-Learning Model.

1,MRI-based radiomics of rectal cancer: preoperative assessment of the pathological features,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the significance of MRI-based radiomics model derived from high-resolution T2-weighted images (T2WIs) in predicting tumor pathological features of rectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 152 patients with rectal cancer who underwent surgery without any neoadjuvant therapy between March 2017 and September 2018 were included retrospectively. The patients were scanned using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, and high-resolution T2WIs were obtained. Lesions were delineated, and 1029 radiomics features were extracted. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select features, and multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were trained using fivefold cross-validation to build a prediction model. The diagnostic performance of the prediction models was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 1029 features were extracted, and 15, 11, and 11 features were selected to predict the degree of differentiation, T stage, and N stage, respectively. The best performance of the radiomics model for the degree of differentiation, T stage, and N stage was obtained by SVM [area under the curve (AUC), 0.862; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.750-0.967; sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 85.0%], MLP (AUC, 0.809; 95% CI, 0.690-0.905; sensitivity, 76.2%; specificity, 74.1%), and RF (AUC, 0.746; 95% CI, 0.622-0.872; sensitivity, 79.3%; specificity, 72.2%).

1,Urine organic acids as potential biomarkers for autism-spectrum disorder in chinese children,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that lacks clear biological biomarkers. Existing diagnostic methods focus on behavioral and performance characteristics, which complicates the diagnosis of patients younger than 3 years-old. The purpose of this study is to characterize metabolic features of ASD that could be used to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and exploration of ASD etiology. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to evaluate major metabolic fluctuations in 76 organic acids present in urine from 156 children with ASD and from 64 non-autistic children. Three algorithms, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used to develop models to distinguish ASD from typically developing (TD) children and to detect potential biomarkers. In an independent testing set, full model of XGBoost with all 76 acids achieved an AUR of 0.94, while reduced model with top 20 acids discovered by voting from these three algorithms achieved 0.93 and represent a good collection of potential ASD biomarkers. In summary, urine organic acids detection with GC/MS combined with XGBoost algorithm could represent a novel and accurate strategy for diagnosis of autism and the discovered potential biomarkers could be valuable for future research on the pathogenesis of autism and possible interventions.","Urine organic acids as potential biomarkers for autism-spectrum disorder in chinese children.

1,"Diagnosis of thyroid cancer using deep convolutional neural network models applied to sonographic images: a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study","BACKGROUND: The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising steadily because of overdiagnosis and overtreatment conferred by widespread use of sensitive imaging techniques for screening. This overall incidence growth is especially driven by increased diagnosis of indolent and well-differentiated papillary subtype and early-stage thyroid cancer, whereas the incidence of advanced-stage thyroid cancer has increased marginally. Thyroid ultrasound is frequently used to diagnose thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to use deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models to improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer by analysing sonographic imaging data from clinical ultrasounds. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study using ultrasound images sets from three hospitals in China. We developed and trained the DCNN model on the training set, 131 731 ultrasound images from 17 627 patients with thyroid cancer and 180 668 images from 25 325 controls from the thyroid imaging database at Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Clinical diagnosis of the training set was made by 16 radiologists from Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Images from anatomical sites that were judged as not having cancer were excluded from the training set and only individuals with suspected thyroid cancer underwent pathological examination to confirm diagnosis. The model's diagnostic performance was validated in an internal validation set from Tianjin Cancer Hospital (8606 images from 1118 patients) and two external datasets in China (the Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Jilin, 741 images from 154 patients; and the Weihai Municipal Hospital, Shandong, 11 039 images from 1420 patients). All individuals with suspected thyroid cancer after clinical examination in the validation sets had pathological examination. We also compared the specificity and sensitivity of the DCNN model with the performance of six skilled thyroid ultrasound radiologists on the three validation sets. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2012, and March 28, 2018, ultrasound images for the four study cohorts were obtained. The model achieved high performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients in the validation sets tested, with area under the curve values of 0.947 (95% CI 0.935-0.959) for the Tianjin internal validation set, 0.912 (95% CI 0.865-0.958) for the Jilin external validation set, and 0.908 (95% CI 0.891-0.925) for the Weihai external validation set. The DCNN model also showed improved performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients versus skilled radiologists. For the Tianjin internal validation set, sensitivity was 93.4% (95% CI 89.6-96.1) versus 96.9% (93.9-98.6; p=0.003) and specificity was 86.1% (81.1-90.2) versus 59.4% (53.0-65.6; p<0.0001). For the Jilin external validation set, sensitivity was 84.3% (95% CI 73.6-91.9) versus 92.9% (84.1-97.6; p=0.048) and specificity was 86.9% (95% CI 77.8-93.3) versus 57.1% (45.9-67.9; p<0.0001). For the Weihai external validation set, sensitivity was 84.7% (95% CI 77.0-90.7) versus 89.0% (81.9-94.0; p=0.25) and specificity was 87.8% (95% CI 81.6-92.5) versus 68.6% (60.7-75.8; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The DCNN model showed similar sensitivity and improved specificity in identifying patients with thyroid cancer compared with a group of skilled radiologists. The improved technical performance of the DCNN model warrants further investigation as part of randomised clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising steadily because of overdiagnosis and overtreatment conferred by widespread use of sensitive imaging techniques for screening. This overall incidence growth is especially driven by increased diagnosis of indolent and well-differentiated papillary subtype and early-stage thyroid cancer, whereas the incidence of advanced-stage thyroid cancer has increased marginally. Thyroid ultrasound is frequently used to diagnose thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to use deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models to improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer by analysing sonographic imaging data from clinical ultrasounds. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study using ultrasound images sets from three hospitals in China. We developed and trained the DCNN model on the training set, 131 731 ultrasound images from 17 627 patients with thyroid cancer and 180 668 images from 25 325 controls from the thyroid imaging database at Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Clinical diagnosis of the training set was made by 16 radiologists from Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Images from anatomical sites that were judged as not having cancer were excluded from the training set and only individuals with suspected thyroid cancer underwent pathological examination to confirm diagnosis. The model's diagnostic performance was validated in an internal validation set from Tianjin Cancer Hospital (8606 images from 1118 patients) and two external datasets in China (the Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Jilin, 741 images from 154 patients; and the Weihai Municipal Hospital, Shandong, 11 039 images from 1420 patients). All individuals with suspected thyroid cancer after clinical examination in the validation sets had pathological examination. We also compared the specificity and sensitivity of the DCNN model with the performance of six skilled thyroid ultrasound radiologists on the three validation sets. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2012, and March 28, 2018, ultrasound images for the four study cohorts were obtained. The model achieved high performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients in the validation sets tested, with area under the curve values of 0.947 (95% CI 0.935-0.959) for the Tianjin internal validation set, 0.912 (95% CI 0.865-0.958) for the Jilin external validation set, and 0.908 (95% CI 0.891-0.925) for the Weihai external validation set.

1,A Deep Learning Approach for Automated Detection of Geographic Atrophy from Color Fundus Photographs,"PURPOSE: To assess the utility of deep learning in the detection of geographic atrophy (GA) from color fundus photographs and to explore potential utility in detecting central GA (CGA). DESIGN: A deep learning model was developed to detect the presence of GA in color fundus photographs, and 2 additional models were developed to detect CGA in different scenarios. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 59 812 color fundus photographs from longitudinal follow-up of 4582 participants in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) dataset. Gold standard labels were from human expert reading center graders using a standardized protocol. METHODS: A deep learning model was trained to use color fundus photographs to predict GA presence from a population of eyes with no AMD to advanced AMD. A second model was trained to predict CGA presence from the same population. A third model was trained to predict CGA presence from the subset of eyes with GA. For training and testing, 5-fold cross-validation was used. For comparison with human clinician performance, model performance was compared with that of 88 retinal specialists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. RESULTS: The deep learning models (GA detection, CGA detection from all eyes, and centrality detection from GA eyes) had AUCs of 0.933-0.976, 0.939-0.976, and 0.827-0.888, respectively. The GA detection model had accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 0.965 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.959-0.971), 0.692 (0.560-0.825), 0.978 (0.970-0.985), and 0.584 (0.491-0.676), respectively, compared with 0.975 (0.971-0.980), 0.588 (0.468-0.707), 0.982 (0.978-0.985), and 0.368 (0.230-0.505) for the retinal specialists. The CGA detection model had values of 0.966 (0.957-0.975), 0.763 (0.641-0.885), 0.971 (0.960-0.982), and 0.394 (0.341-0.448).

CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model demonstrated high accuracy for the automated detection of GA. The AUC was noninferior to that of human retinal specialists. Deep learning approaches may also be applied to the identification of CGA. The code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet.","A Deep Learning Approach for Automated Detection of Geographic Atrophy from Color Fundus Photographs.

1,An approach for transgender population information extraction and summarization from clinical trial text,"BACKGROUND: Gender information frequently exists in the eligibility criteria of clinical trial text as essential information for participant population recruitment. Particularly, current eligibility criteria text contains the incompleteness and ambiguity issues in expressing transgender population, leading to difficulties or even failure of transgender population recruitment in clinical trial studies. METHODS: A new gender model is proposed for providing comprehensive transgender requirement specification. In addition, an automated approach is developed to extract and summarize gender requirements from unstructured text in accordance with the gender model. This approach consists of: 1) the feature extraction module, and 2) the feature summarization module. The first module identifies and extracts gender features using heuristic rules and automatically-generated patterns. The second module summarizes gender requirements by relation inference. RESULTS: Based on 100,134 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov , our approach was compared with 20 commonly applied machine learning methods. It achieved a macro-averaged precision of 0.885, a macro-averaged recall of 0.871 and a macro-averaged F1-measure of 0.878. The results illustrated that our approach outperformed all baseline methods in terms of both commonly used metrics and macro-averaged metrics. CONCLUSIONS: This study presented a new gender model aiming for specifying the transgender requirement more precisely. We also proposed an approach for gender information extraction and summarization from unstructured clinical text to enhance transgender-related clinical trial population recruitment. The experiment results demonstrated that the approach was effective in transgender criteria extraction and summarization.","An approach for transgender population information extraction and summarization from clinical trial text.

1,Neural network-derived perfusion maps for the assessment of lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke,"Purpose: To perform a proof-of-concept study to investigate the clinical utility of perfusion maps derived from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the workup of patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting with a large vessel occlusion. Materials and Methods: Data on endovascularly treated patients with acute ischemic stroke (n = 151; median age, 68 years [interquartile range, 59-75 years]; 82 of 151 [54.3%] women) were retrospectively extracted from a single-center institutional prospective registry (between January 2011 and December 2015). Dynamic susceptibility perfusion imaging data were processed by applying a commercially available reference method and in parallel by a recently proposed CNN method to automatically infer time to maximum of the tissue residue function (Tmax) perfusion maps. The outputs were compared by using quantitative markers of tissue at risk derived from manual segmentations of perfusion lesions from two expert raters. Results: Strong correlations of lesion volumes (Tmax. 4 seconds, 6 seconds, and. 8 seconds; R = 0.865-0.914; P 001) and good spatial overlap of respective lesion segmentations (Dice coefficients, 0.70-0.85) between the CNN method and reference output were observed. Eligibility for late-window reperfusion treatment was feasible with use of the CNN method, with complete interrater agreement for the CNN method (Cohen k = 1; P. 001), although slight discrepancies compared with the reference-based output were observed (Cohen k = 0.609-0.64; P 001). The CNN method tended to underestimate smaller lesion volumes, leading to a disagreement between the CNN and reference method in five of 45 patients (9%). Conclusion: Compared with standard deconvolution-based processing of raw perfusion data, automatic CNN-derived Tmax perfusion maps can be applied to patients who have acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke, with similar clinical utility.","Neural network-derived perfusion maps for the assessment of lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

1,Use of Crowd Innovation to Develop an Artificial Intelligence-Based Solution for Radiation Therapy Targeting,"Importance: Radiation therapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, but the existing radiation oncologist work force does not meet growing global demand. One key physician task in RT planning involves tumor segmentation for targeting, which requires substantial training and is subject to significant interobserver variation. Objective: To determine whether crowd innovation could be used to rapidly produce artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that replicate the accuracy of an expert radiation oncologist in segmenting lung tumors for RT targeting. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a 10-week, prize-based, online, 3-phase challenge (prizes totaled $55000). A well-curated data set, including computed tomographic (CT) scans and lung tumor segmentations generated by an expert for clinical care, was used for the contest (CT scans from 461 patients; median 157 images per scan; 77942 images in total; 8144 images with tumor present). Contestants were provided a training set of 229 CT scans with accompanying expert contours to develop their algorithms and given feedback on their performance throughout the contest, including from the expert clinician. Main Outcomes and Measures: The AI algorithms generated by contestants were automatically scored on an independent data set that was withheld from contestants, and performance ranked using quantitative metrics that evaluated overlap of each algorithm's automated segmentations with the expert's segmentations. Performance was further benchmarked against human expert interobserver and intraobserver variation. Results: A total of 564 contestants from 62 countries registered for this challenge, and 34 (6%) submitted algorithms. The automated segmentations produced by the top 5 AI algorithms, when combined using an ensemble model, had an accuracy (Dice coefficient = 0.79) that was within the benchmark of mean interobserver variation measured between 6 human experts. For phase 1, the top 7 algorithms had average custom segmentation scores (S scores) on the holdout data set ranging from 0.15 to 0.38, and suboptimal performance using relative measures of error. The average S scores for phase 2 increased to 0.53 to 0.57, with a similar improvement in other performance metrics. In phase 3, performance of the top algorithm increased by an additional 9%. Combining the top 5 algorithms from phase 2 and phase 3 using an ensemble model, yielded an additional 9% to 12% improvement in performance with a final S score reaching 0.68. Conclusions and Relevance: A combined crowd innovation and AI approach rapidly produced automated algorithms that replicated the skills of a highly trained physician for a critical task in radiation therapy. These AI algorithms could improve cancer care globally by transferring the skills of expert clinicians to under-resourced health care settings.","Use of Crowd Innovation to Develop an Artificial Intelligence-Based Solution for Radiation Therapy Targeting.

1,Binomial classification of pediatric elbow fractures using a deep learning multiview approach emulating radiologist decision making,"Purpose: To determine the feasibility of using deep learning with a multiview approach, similar to how a human radiologist reviews multiple images, for binomial classification of acute pediatric elbow radiographic abnormalities. Materials and Methods: A total of 21â€‰456 radiographic studies containing 58â€‰817 images of the elbow and associated radiology reports over the course of a 4-year period from January 2014 through December 2017 at a dedicated childrenâ€™s hospital were retrospectively retrieved. Mean age was 7.2 years, and 43% were female patients. The studies were binomially classified, based on the reports, as either positive or negative for acute or subacute traumatic abnormality. The studies were randomly divided into a training set containing 20â€‰350 studies and a validation set containing the remaining 1106 studies. A multiview approach was used for the model by combining both a convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network to interpret an entire series of three radiographs together. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: AUC was 0.95, and accuracy was 88% for the model on the studied dataset. Sensitivity for the model was 91% (536 of 590), while the specificity for the model was 84% (434 of 516). Of 241 supracondylar fractures, one was missed. Of 88 lateral condylar fractures, one was missed. Of 77 elbow effusions without fracture, 15 were missed. Of 184 other abnormalities, 37 were missed. Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively classify acute and nonacute pediatric elbow abnormalities on radiographs in the setting of trauma. A recurrent neural network was used to classify an entire radiographic series, arrive at a decision based on all views, and identify fractures in pediatric patients with variable skeletal immaturity.","Binomial classification of pediatric elbow fractures using a deep learning multiview approach emulating radiologist decision making.

1,Quantifying in situ adaptive immune cell cognate interactions in humans,"Two-photon excitation microscopy (TPEM) has revolutionized the understanding of adaptive immunity. However, TPEM usually requires animal models and is not amenable to the study of human disease. The recognition of antigen by T cells requires cell contact and is associated with changes in T cell shape. We postulated that by capturing these features in fixed tissue samples, we could quantify in situ adaptive immunity. Therefore, we used a deep convolutional neural network to identify fundamental distance and cell-shape features associated with cognate help (cell-distance mapping (CDM)). In mice, CDM was comparable to TPEM in discriminating cognate T cell-dendritic cell (DC) interactions from non-cognate T cell-DC interactions. In human lupus nephritis, CDM confirmed that myeloid DCs present antigen to CD4(+) T cells and identified plasmacytoid DCs as an important antigen-presenting cell. These data reveal a new approach with which to study human in situ adaptive immunity broadly applicable to autoimmunity, infection, and cancer.","Quantifying in situ adaptive immune cell cognate interactions in humans.

1,A low-cost vision system based on the analysis of motor features for recognition and severity rating of Parkinson's Disease,"BACKGROUND: Assessment and rating of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are commonly based on the medical observation of several clinical manifestations, including the analysis of motor activities. In particular, medical specialists refer to the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - sponsored revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) that is the most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity. METHODS: In this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according to MDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects. In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution. RESULTS: Concerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity. Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect subtle phenomena featuring the PD. Our findings suggest that the proposed tool can support medical specialists in the assessment and rating of PD patients in a real clinical scenario.","A low-cost vision system based on the analysis of motor features for recognition and severity rating of Parkinson's Disease.

METHODS: In this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according to MDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects. In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution. RESULTS: Concerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity. Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect subtle phenomena featuring the PD. Our findings suggest that the proposed tool can support medical specialists in the assessment and rating of PD patients in a real clinical scenario."
1,A study of deep learning methods for de-identification of clinical notes in cross-institute settings,"BACKGROUND: De-identification is a critical technology to facilitate the use of unstructured clinical text while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. The clinical natural language processing (NLP) community has invested great efforts in developing methods and corpora for de-identification of clinical notes. These annotated corpora are valuable resources for developing automated systems to de-identify clinical text at local hospitals. However, existing studies often utilized training and test data collected from the same institution. There are few studies to explore automated de-identification under cross-institute settings. The goal of this study is to examine deep learning-based de-identification methods at a cross-institute setting, identify the bottlenecks, and provide potential solutions. METHODS: We created a de-identification corpus using a total 500 clinical notes from the University of Florida (UF) Health, developed deep learning-based de-identification models using 2014 i2b2/UTHealth corpus, and evaluated the performance using UF corpus. We compared five different word embeddings trained from the general English text, clinical text, and biomedical literature, explored lexical and linguistic features, and compared two strategies to customize the deep learning models using UF notes and resources. RESULTS: Pre-trained word embeddings using a general English corpus achieved better performance than embeddings from de-identified clinical text and biomedical literature. The performance of deep learning models trained using only i2b2 corpus significantly dropped (strict and relax F1 scores dropped from 0.9547 and 0.9646 to 0.8568 and 0.8958) when applied to another corpus annotated at UF Health. Linguistic features could further improve the performance of de-identification in cross-institute settings. After customizing the models using UF notes and resource, the best model achieved the strict and relaxed F1 scores of 0.9288 and 0.9584, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to customize de-identification models using local clinical text and other resources when applied in cross-institute settings. Fine-tuning is a potential solution to re-use pre-trained parameters and reduce the training time to customize deep learning-based de-identification models trained using clinical corpus from a different institution.","A study of deep learning methods for de-identification of clinical notes in cross-institute settings.

1,Representation learning in intraoperative vital signs for heart failure risk prediction,"BACKGROUND: The probability of heart failure during the perioperative period is 2% on average and it is as high as 17% when accompanied by cardiovascular diseases in China. It has been the most significant cause of postoperative death of patients. However, the patient is managed by the flow of information during the operation, but a lot of clinical information can make it difficult for medical staff to identify the information relevant to patient care. There are major practical and technical barriers to understand perioperative complications. METHODS: In this work, we present three machine learning methods to estimate risks of heart failure, which extract intraoperative vital signs monitoring data into different modal representations (statistical learning representation, text learning representation, image learning representation). Firstly, we extracted features of vital signs monitoring data of surgical patients by statistical analysis. Secondly, the vital signs data is converted into text information by Piecewise Approximate Aggregation (PAA) and Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX), then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to extract text topics of patients for heart failure prediction. Thirdly, the vital sign monitoring time series data of the surgical patient is converted into a grid image by using the grid representation, and then the convolutional neural network is directly used to identify the grid image for heart failure prediction. We evaluated the proposed methods in the monitoring data of real patients during the perioperative period. RESULTS: In this paper, the results of our experiment demonstrate the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) classifier achieves the best results in the prediction of heart failure by statistical feature representation. The sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) of the best method can reach 83, 85 and 84% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results demonstrate that representation learning model of vital signs monitoring data of intraoperative patients can effectively capture the physiological characteristics of postoperative heart failure.","Representation learning in intraoperative vital signs for heart failure risk prediction.

1,A validated natural language processing algorithm for brain imaging phenotypes from radiology reports in UK electronic health records,"BACKGROUND: Manual coding of phenotypes in brain radiology reports is time consuming. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to enable automatic identification of brain imaging in radiology reports performed in routine clinical practice in the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: We used anonymized text brain imaging reports from a cohort study of stroke/TIA patients and from a regional hospital to develop and test an NLP algorithm. Two experts marked up text in 1692 reports for 24 cerebrovascular and other neurological phenotypes. We developed and tested a rule-based NLP algorithm first within the cohort study, and further evaluated it in the reports from the regional hospital. RESULTS: The agreement between expert readers was excellent (Cohen's Îº =0.93) in both datasets. In the final test dataset (nÂ =â€‰700) in unseen regional hospital reports, the algorithm had very good performance for a report of any ischaemic stroke [sensitivity 89% (95% CI:81-94); positive predictive value (PPV) 85% (76-90); specificity 100% (95% CI:0.99-1.00)]; any haemorrhagic stroke [sensitivity 96% (95% CI: 80-99), PPV 72% (95% CI:55-84); specificity 100% (95% CI:0.99-1.00)]; brain tumours [sensitivity 96% (CI:87-99); PPV 84% (73-91); specificity: 100% (95% CI:0.99-1.00)] and cerebral small vessel disease and cerebral atrophy (sensitivity, PPV and specificity all >â€‰97%). We obtained few reports of subarachnoid haemorrhage, microbleeds or subdural haematomas. In 110,695 reports from NHS Tayside, atrophy (nÂ =â€‰28,757, 26%), small vessel disease (15,015, 14%) and old, deep ischaemic strokes (10,636, 10%) were the commonest findings. CONCLUSIONS: An NLP algorithm can be developed in UK NHS radiology records to allow identification of cohorts of patients with important brain imaging phenotypes at a scale that would otherwise not be possible.","A validated natural language processing algorithm for brain imaging phenotypes from radiology reports in UK electronic health records.

1,Development and Assessment of a Machine Learning Model to Help Predict Survival among Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Importance: Predicting survival of oral squamous cell carcinoma through the use of prediction modeling has been underused, and the development of prediction models would augment clinicians' ability to provide absolute risk estimates for individual patients. Objectives: To develop a prediction model using machine learning for 5-year overall survival among patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and compare this model with a prediction model created from the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) clinical and pathologic stage. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 33065 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma from the National Cancer Data Base between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011. Patients were excluded if the treatment was considered palliative, staging demonstrated T0 or Tis, or survival or staging data were missing. Patient, tumor, treatment, and outcome information were obtained from the National Cancer Data Base. The data were split into a distribution of 80% for training and 20% for testing. The model was created using 2-class decision forest architecture. Permutation feature importance scores were used to determine the variables that were used in the model's prediction and their order of significance. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 1, 2018, to January 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ability to predict 5-year overall survival assessed through area under the curve, accuracy, precision, and recall. Results: Among the 33065 patients in the study, the mean (SD) age was 64.6 (14.0) years, 19791 were men (59.9%), 13 274 were women (40.1%), and 29783 (90.1%) were white. At 60 months, there were 16745 deaths (50.6%). The median time of follow-up was 56.8 months (range, 0-155.6 months). Age, pathologic T stage, positive margins at the time of surgery, lymph node size, and institutional identification were identified among the most significant variables. The calculated area under the curve for this machine learning model was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.79-0.81), accuracy was 71%, precision was 71%, and recall was 68%. In comparison, the calculated area under the curve of the TNM staging system was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.70), accuracy was 65%, precision was 69%, and recall was 52%. Conclusions and Relevance: Using machine learning algorithms, a prediction model was created based on patient social, demographic, clinical, and pathologic features. The developed prediction model proved to be better than a prediction model that exclusively used TNM pathologic and clinical stage according to all performance metrics. This study highlights the role that machine learning may play in individual patient risk estimation in the era of big data.","Development and Assessment of a Machine Learning Model to Help Predict Survival among Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

1,Cell mitosis event analysis in phase contrast microscopy images using deep learning,"In this paper, we solve the problem of mitosis event localization and its stage localization in time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy images. Our method contains three steps: first, we formulate a Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (LRMR) model to find salient regions from microscopy images and extract candidate patch sequences, which potentially contain mitosis events; second, we classify each candidate patch sequence by our proposed Hierarchical Convolution Neural Network (HCNN) with visual appearance and motion cues; third, for the detected mitosis sequences, we further segment them into four temporal stages by our proposed Two-stream Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (TS-BLSTM). In the experiments, we validate our system (LRMR, HCNN, and TS-BLSTM) and evaluate the mitosis event localization and stage localization performance. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts by achieving 99.2% precision and 98.0% recall for mitosis event localization and 0.62 frame error on average for mitosis stage localization in five challenging image sequences.","Cell mitosis event analysis in phase contrast microscopy images using deep learning.

1,Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Aid Discharge Processes for Inpatient Surgical Care,"Importance: Inpatient overcrowding is associated with delays in care, including the deferral of surgical care until beds are available to accommodate postoperative patients. Timely patient discharge is critical to address inpatient overcrowding and requires coordination among surgeons, nurses, case managers, and others. This is difficult to achieve without early identification and systemwide transparency of discharge candidates and their respective barriers to discharge. Objective: To validate the performance of a clinically interpretable feedforward neural network model that could improve the discharge process by predicting which patients would be discharged within 24 hours and their clinical and nonclinical barriers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study included adult patients discharged from inpatient surgical care from May 1, 2016, to August 31, 2017, at a quaternary care teaching hospital. Model performance was assessed with standard cross-validation techniques. The model's performance was compared with a baseline model using historical procedure median length of stay to predict discharges. In prospective cohort analysis, the feedforward neural network model was used to make predictions on general surgical care floors with 63 beds. If patients were not discharged when predicted, the causes of delay were recorded. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model. Secondary outcomes included the causes of discharge delay and the number of avoidable bed-days. Results: The model was trained on 15â€¯201 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60 [46-70] years; 7623 [50.1%] men) discharged from inpatient surgical care. The estimated out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.840 (SD, 0.008; 95% CI, 0.839-0.844). Compared with the baseline model, the neural network model had higher sensitivity (52.5% vs 56.6%) and specificity (51.7% vs 82.6%). The neural network model identified 65 barriers to discharge. In the prospective study of 605 patients, causes of delays included clinical barriers (41 patients [30.1%]), variation in clinical practice (30 patients [22.1%]), and nonclinical reasons (65 patients [47.8%]). Summing patients who were not discharged owing to variation in clinical practice and nonclinical reasons, 128 bed-days, or 1.2 beds per day, were classified as avoidable. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that a neural network model could predict daily inpatient surgical care discharges and their barriers. The model identified systemic causes of discharge delays. Such models should be studied for their ability to increase the timeliness of discharges.","Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Aid Discharge Processes for Inpatient Surgical Care.

1,An attention-based deep learning model for clinical named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records,"BACKGROUND: Clinical named entity recognition (CNER) is important for medical information mining and establishment of high-quality knowledge map. Due to the different text features from natural language and a large number of professional and uncommon clinical terms in Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs), there are still many difficulties in clinical named entity recognition of Chinese EMRs. It is of great importance to eliminate semantic interference and improve the ability of autonomous learning of internal features of the model under the small training corpus. METHODS: From the perspective of deep learning, we integrated the attention mechanism into neural network, and proposed an improved clinical named entity recognition method for Chinese electronic medical records called BiLSTM-Att-CRF, which could capture more useful information of the context and avoid the problem of missing information caused by long-distance factors. In addition, medical dictionaries and part-of-speech (POS) features were also introduced to improve the performance of the model. RESULTS: Based on China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing (CCKS) 2017 and 2018 Chinese EMRs corpus, our BiLSTM-Att-CRF model finally achieved better performance than other widely-used models without additional features(F1-measure of 85.4% in CCKS 2018, F1-measure of 90.29% in CCKS 2017), and achieved the best performance with POS and dictionary features (F1-measure of 86.11% in CCKS 2018, F1-measure of 90.48% in CCKS 2017). In particular, the BiLSTM-Att-CRF model had significant effect on the improvement of Recall. CONCLUSIONS: Our work preliminarily confirmed the validity of attention mechanism in discovering key information and mining text features, which might provide useful ideas for future research in clinical named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records. In the future, we will explore the deeper application of attention mechanism in neural network.","An attention-based deep learning model for clinical named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records.

1,Association Between Surgical Skin Markings in Dermoscopic Images and Diagnostic Performance of a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Melanoma Recognition,"Importance: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a performance at the level of dermatologists in the diagnosis of melanoma. Accordingly, further exploring the potential limitations of CNN technology before broadly applying it is of special interest. Objective: To investigate the association between gentian violet surgical skin markings in dermoscopic images and the diagnostic performance of a CNN approved for use as a medical device in the European market. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted from August 1, 2018, to November 30, 2018, using a CNN architecture trained with more than 120 000 dermoscopic images of skin neoplasms and corresponding diagnoses. The association of gentian violet skin markings in dermoscopic images with the performance of the CNN was investigated in 3 image sets of 130 melanocytic lesions each (107 benign nevi, 23 melanomas). Exposures: The same lesions were sequentially imaged with and without the application of a gentian violet surgical skin marker and then evaluated by the CNN for their probability of being a melanoma. In addition, the markings were removed by manually cropping the dermoscopic images to focus on the melanocytic lesion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the CNN's diagnostic classification in unmarked, marked, and cropped images. Results: In all, 130 melanocytic lesions (107 benign nevi and 23 melanomas) were imaged. In unmarked lesions, the CNN achieved a sensitivity of 95.7% (95% CI, 79%-99.2%) and a specificity of 84.1% (95% CI, 76.0%-89.8%). The ROC AUC was 0.969. In marked lesions, an increase in melanoma probability scores was observed that resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%) and a significantly reduced specificity of 45.8% (95% CI, 36.7%-55.2%, P < .001). The ROC AUC was 0.922. Cropping images led to the highest sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%), specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 92.1%-99.0%), and ROC AUC of 0.993. Heat maps created by vanilla gradient descent backpropagation indicated that the blue markings were associated with the increased false-positive rate. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that skin markings significantly interfered with the CNN's correct diagnosis of nevi by increasing the melanoma probability scores and consequently the false-positive rate. A predominance of skin markings in melanoma training images may have induced the CNN's association of markings with a melanoma diagnosis. Accordingly, these findings suggest that skin markings should be avoided in dermoscopic images intended for analysis by a CNN.

Importance: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a performance at the level of dermatologists in the diagnosis of melanoma. Accordingly, further exploring the potential limitations of CNN technology before broadly applying it is of special interest. Objective: To investigate the association between gentian violet surgical skin markings in dermoscopic images and the diagnostic performance of a CNN approved for use as a medical device in the European market. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted from August 1, 2018, to November 30, 2018, using a CNN architecture trained with more than 120 000 dermoscopic images of skin neoplasms and corresponding diagnoses. The association of gentian violet skin markings in dermoscopic images with the performance of the CNN was investigated in 3 image sets of 130 melanocytic lesions each (107 benign nevi, 23 melanomas). Exposures: The same lesions were sequentially imaged with and without the application of a gentian violet surgical skin marker and then evaluated by the CNN for their probability of being a melanoma. In addition, the markings were removed by manually cropping the dermoscopic images to focus on the melanocytic lesion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the CNN's diagnostic classification in unmarked, marked, and cropped images. Results: In all, 130 melanocytic lesions (107 benign nevi and 23 melanomas) were imaged. In unmarked lesions, the CNN achieved a sensitivity of 95.7% (95% CI, 79%-99.2%) and a specificity of 84.1% (95% CI, 76.0%-89.8%). The ROC AUC was 0.969. In marked lesions, an increase in melanoma probability scores was observed that resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%) and a significantly reduced specificity of 45.8% (95% CI, 36.7%-55.2%, P < .001). The ROC AUC was 0.922. Cropping images led to the highest sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100%), specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 92.1%-99.0%), and ROC AUC of 0.993. Heat maps created by vanilla gradient descent backpropagation indicated that the blue markings were associated with the increased false-positive rate. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that skin markings significantly interfered with the CNN's correct diagnosis of nevi by increasing the melanoma probability scores and consequently the false-positive rate. A predominance of skin markings in melanoma training images may have induced the CNN's association of markings with a melanoma diagnosis. Accordingly, these findings suggest that skin markings should be avoided in dermoscopic images intended for analysis by a CNN.

1,Deep-learning model for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative mortality occurs in 1-2% of patients undergoing major inpatient surgery. The currently available prediction tools using summaries of intraoperative data are limited by their inability to reflect shifting risk associated with intraoperative physiological perturbations. We sought to compare similar benchmarks to a deep-learning algorithm predicting postoperative 30-day mortality. METHODS: We constructed a multipath convolutional neural network model using patient characteristics, co-morbid conditions, preoperative laboratory values, and intraoperative numerical data from patients undergoing surgery with tracheal intubation at a single medical centre. Data for 60 min prior to a randomly selected time point were utilised. Model performance was compared with a deep neural network, a random forest, a support vector machine, and a logistic regression using predetermined summary statistics of intraoperative data. RESULTS: Of 95 907 patients, 941 (1%) died within 30 days. The multipath convolutional neural network predicted postoperative 30-day mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.835-0.899). This was higher than that for the deep neural network (0.825; 95% CI: 0.790-0.860), random forest (0.848; 95% CI: 0.815-0.882), support vector machine (0.836; 95% CI: 0.802-870), and logistic regression (0.837; 95% CI: 0.803-0.871). CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning time-series model improves prediction compared with models with simple summaries of intraoperative data. We have created a model that can be used in real time to detect dynamic changes in a patient's risk for postoperative mortality.","Deep-learning model for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality.

1,Machine Learning Approach to Inpatient Violence Risk Assessment Using Routinely Collected Clinical Notes in Electronic Health Records,"Importance: Inpatient violence remains a significant problem despite existing risk assessment methods. The lack of robustness and the high degree of effort needed to use current methods might be mitigated by using routinely registered clinical notes. Objective: To develop and validate a multivariable prediction model for assessing inpatient violence risk based on machine learning techniques applied to clinical notes written in patients' electronic health records. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used retrospective clinical notes registered in electronic health records during admission at 2 independent psychiatric health care institutions in the Netherlands. No exclusion criteria for individual patients were defined. At site 1, all adults admitted between January 2013 and August 2018 were included, and at site 2 all adults admitted to general psychiatric wards between June 2016 and August 2018 were included. Data were analyzed between September 2018 and February 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Predictive validity and generalizability of prognostic models measured using area under the curve (AUC). Results: Clinical notes recorded during a total of 3189 admissions of 2209 unique individuals at site 1 (mean [SD] age, 34.0 [16.6] years; 1536 [48.2%] male) and 3253 admissions of 1919 unique individuals at site 2 (mean [SD] age, 45.9 [16.6] years; 2097 [64.5%] male) were analyzed. Violent outcome was determined using the Staff Observation Aggression Scale-Revised. Nested cross-validation was used to train and evaluate models that assess violence risk during the first 4 weeks of admission based on clinical notes available after 24 hours. The predictive validity of models was measured at site 1 (AUC = 0.797; 95% CI, 0.771-0.822) and site 2 (AUC = 0.764; 95% CI, 0.732-0.797). The validation of pretrained models in the other site resulted in AUCs of 0.722 (95% CI, 0.690-0.753) at site 1 and 0.643 (95% CI, 0.610-0.675) at site 2; the difference in AUCs between the internally trained model and the model trained on other-site data was significant at site 1 (AUC difference = 0.075; 95% CI, 0.045-0.105; P <.001) and site 2 (AUC difference = 0.121; 95% CI, 0.085-0.156; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Internally validated predictions resulted in AUC values with good predictive validity, suggesting that automatic violence risk assessment using routinely registered clinical notes is possible. The validation of trained models using data from other sites corroborates previous findings that violence risk assessment generalizes modestly to different populations.","Machine Learning Approach to Inpatient Violence Risk Assessment Using Routinely Collected Clinical Notes in Electronic Health Records.

1,An augmented reality microscope with real-time artificial intelligence integration for cancer diagnosis,"The microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. However, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. Though artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying AI solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. Here we propose a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (ARM). The ARM overlays AI-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of AI into routine workflows. We demonstrate the utility of ARM in the detection of metastatic breast cancer and the identification of prostate cancer, with latency compatible with real-time use. We anticipate that the ARM will remove barriers towards the use of AI designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis.","An augmented reality microscope with real-time artificial intelligence integration for cancer diagnosis.

1,Simultaneous detection of genotype and phenotype enables rapid and accurate antibiotic susceptibility determination,"Multidrug resistant organisms are a serious threat to human health(1,2). Fast, accurate antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is a critical need in addressing escalating antibiotic resistance, since delays in identifying multidrug resistant organisms increase mortality(3,4) and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further selecting for resistant organisms. Yet current growth-based AST assays, such as broth microdilution(5), require several days before informing key clinical decisions. Rapid AST would transform the care of patients with infection while ensuring that our antibiotic arsenal is deployed as efficiently as possible. Growth-based assays are fundamentally constrained in speed by doubling time of the pathogen, and genotypic assays are limited by the ever-growing diversity and complexity of bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Here we describe a rapid assay for combined genotypic and phenotypic AST through RNA detection, GoPhAST-R, that classifies strains with 94-99% accuracy by coupling machine learning analysis of early antibiotic-induced transcriptional changes with simultaneous detection of key genetic resistance determinants to increase accuracy of resistance detection, facilitate molecular epidemiology and enable early detection of emerging resistance mechanisms. This two-pronged approach provides phenotypic AST 24-36 h faster than standard workflows, with <4 h assay time on a pilot instrument for hybridization-based multiplexed RNA detection implemented directly from positive blood cultures.","Simultaneous detection of genotype and phenotype enables rapid and accurate antibiotic susceptibility determination.

1,EXTraction of EMR numerical data: an efficient and generalizable tool to EXTEND clinical research,"BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMR) contain numerical data important for clinical outcomes research, such as vital signs and cardiac ejection fractions (EF), which tend to be embedded in narrative clinical notes. In current practice, this data is often manually extracted for use in research studies. However, due to the large volume of notes in datasets, manually extracting numerical data often becomes infeasible. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) tool that can efficiently extract numerical clinical data from narrative notes. RESULTS: To validate the accuracy of the tool EXTraction of EMR Numerical Data (EXTEND), we developed a reference standard by manually extracting vital signs from 285 notes, EF values from 300 notes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and serum creatinine from 890 notes. For each parameter of interest, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 score of EXTEND using two metrics. (1) completion of data extraction, and (2) accuracy of data extraction compared to the actual values in the note verified by chart review. At the note level, extraction by EXTEND was considered correct only if it accurately detected and extracted all values of interest in a note. Using manually-annotated labels as the gold standard, the note-level accuracy of EXTEND in capturing the numerical vital sign values, EF, HbA1C and creatinine ranged from 0.88 to 0.95 for sensitivity, 0.95 to 1.0 for specificity, 0.95 to 1.0 for PPV, 0.89 to 0.99 for NPV, and 0.92 to 0.96 in F1 scores. Compared to the actual value level, the sensitivity, PPV, and F1 score of EXTEND ranged from 0.91 to 0.95, 0.95 to 1.0 and 0.95 to 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: EXTEND is an efficient, flexible tool that uses knowledge-based rules to extract clinical numerical parameters with high accuracy. By increasing dictionary terms and developing new rules, the usage of EXTEND can easily be expanded to extract additional numerical data important in clinical outcomes research.","EXTraction of EMR numerical data: an efficient and generalizable tool to EXTEND clinical research.

1,Implementation of machine learning algorithms to create diabetic patient re-admission profiles,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms, and it enables today's computers to have the property of learning. Machine learning is gradually growing and becoming a critical approach in many domains such as health, education, and business. METHODS: In this paper, we applied machine learning to the diabetes dataset with the aim of recognizing patterns and combinations of factors that characterizes or explain re-admission among diabetes patients. The classifiers used include Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, J48 and Support vector machine. RESULTS: Of the 100,000 cases, 78,363 were diabetic and over 47% were readmitted.Based on the classes that models produced, diabetic patients who are more likely to be readmitted are either women, or Caucasians, or outpatients, or those who undergo less rigorous lab procedures, treatment procedures, or those who receive less medication, and are thus discharged without proper improvements or administration of insulin despite having been tested positive for HbA1c. CONCLUSION: Diabetic patients who do not undergo vigorous lab assessments, diagnosis, medications are more likely to be readmitted when discharged without improvements and without receiving insulin administration, especially if they are women, Caucasians, or both.","Implementation of machine learning algorithms to create diabetic patient re-admission profiles.

However, their architectures are manually designed for particular problems. On the one hand, a manual designing process requires many trials to tune a large number of hyperparameters and is thus quite a time-consuming task. On the other hand, the fittest hyperparameters that can adapt to source data properties (e.g., sparsity, noisy features) are not able to be quickly identified for target data properties. For instance, the realistic noise in medical images is usually mixed and complicated, and sometimes unknown, leading to challenges in applying existing methods directly and creating effective denoising neural networks easily. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based network evolution approach to search for the fittest genes to optimize network structures automatically. We expedite the evolutionary process through an experience-based greedy exploration strategy and transfer learning. Our evolutionary algorithm procedure has flexibility, which allows taking advantage of current state-of-the-art modules (e.g., residual blocks) to search for promising neural networks. We evaluate our framework on a classic medical image analysis task: denoising. The experimental results on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) image denoising demonstrate the capability of the method to select the fittest genes for building high-performance networks, named EvoNets.

1,Biomarkers identify the Binswanger type of vascular cognitive impairment,"Binswangerâ€™s disease is a form of subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD-BD) with extensive white matter changes. To test the hypothesis that biomarkers could improve classification of SIVD-BD, we recruited 62 vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) patients. Multimodal biomarkers were collected at entry into the study based on clinical and neuropsychological testing, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The patientsâ€™ diagnoses were confirmed by long-term follow-up, and they formed a â€œtraining setâ€ to test classification methods, including (1) subcortical ischemic vascular disease score (SIVDS), (2) exploratory factor analysis (EFA), (3) logistic regression (LR), and (4) random forest (RF). A subsequently recruited cohort of 43 VCID patients with provisional diagnoses were used as a â€œtestâ€ set to calculate the probability of SIVD-BD based on biomarkers obtained at entry. We found that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was the best variable for classification, followed by matrix metalloproteinase-2 in CSF and bloodâ€“brain barrier permeability on MRI. Both LR and RF performed better in diagnosing SIVD-BD than either EFA or SIVDS. Two-year follow-up of provisional diagnosis patients confirmed the accuracy of statistically derived classifications. We propose that biomarker-based classification methods could diagnose SIVD-BD patients earlier, facilitating clinical trials.","Biomarkers identify the Binswanger type of vascular cognitive impairment.

1,Improving automated pediatric bone age estimation using ensembles of models from the 2017 RSNA machine learning challenge,"Purpose: To investigate improvements in performance for automatic bone age estimation that can be gained through model ensembling. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 submissions from the 2017 RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge were used. Participants were provided with 12 611 pediatric hand radiographs with bone ages determined by a pediatric radiologist to develop models for bone age determination. The final results were determined using a test set of 200 radiographs labeled with the weighted average of six ratings. The mean pairwise model correlation and performance of all possible model combinations for ensembles of up to 10 models using the mean absolute deviation (MAD) were evaluated. A bootstrap analysis using the 200 test radiographs was conducted to estimate the true generalization MAD. Results: The estimated generalization MAD of a single model was 4.55 months. The best-performing ensemble consisted of four models with an MAD of 3.79 months. The mean pairwise correlation of models within this ensemble was 0.47. In comparison, the lowest achievable MAD by combining the highest-ranking models based on individual scores was 3.93 months using eight models with a mean pairwise model correlation of 0.67. Conclusion: Combining less-correlated, high-performing models resulted in better performance than naively combining the top-performing models. Machine learning competitions within radiology should be encouraged to spur development of heterogeneous models whose predictions can be combined to achieve optimal performance.","Improving automated pediatric bone age estimation using ensembles of models from the 2017 RSNA machine learning challenge.

The DNN was trained using 2 (leads I and II) or 4 (leads I, II, V3, and V5) ECG leads to detect serum potassium levels of 5.5 mEq/L or less (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1) and was validated using retrospective data from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona. The validation included 61965 patients with stage 3 or greater CKD. Each patient had a serum potassium count drawn within 4 hours after their ECG was recorded. Data were analyzed between April 12, 2018, and June 25, 2018. Exposures: Use of a deep-learning model. Main Outcomes and Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity, with serum potassium level as the reference standard. The model was evaluated at 2 operating points, 1 for equal specificity and sensitivity and another for high (90%) sensitivity. Results: Of the total 1638546 ECGs, 908000 (55%) were from men. The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the 3 validation data sets ranged from 2.6% (n = 1282 of 50099; Minnesota) to 4.8% (n = 287 of 6011; Florida). Using ECG leads I and II, the AUC of the deep-learning model was 0.883 (95% CI, 0.873-0.893) for Minnesota, 0.860 (95% CI, 0.837-0.883) for Florida, and 0.853 (95% CI, 0.830-0.877) for Arizona. Using a 90% sensitivity operating point, the sensitivity was 90.2% (95% CI, 88.4%-91.7%) and specificity was 63.2% (95% CI, 62.7%-63.6%) for Minnesota; the sensitivity was 91.3% (95% CI, 87.4%-94.3%) and specificity was 54.7% (95% CI, 53.4%-56.0%) for Florida; and the sensitivity was 88.9% (95% CI, 84.5%-92.4%) and specificity was 55.0% (95% CI, 53.7%-56.3%) for Arizona. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, using only 2 ECG leads, a deep-learning model detected hyperkalemia in patients with renal disease with an AUC of 0.853 to 0.883. The application of artificial intelligence to the ECG may enable screening for hyperkalemia. Prospective studies are warranted..","Development and Validation of a Deep-Learning Model to Screen for Hyperkalemia from the Electrocardiogram. Importance: For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperkalemia is common, associated with fatal arrhythmias, and often asymptomatic, while guideline-directed monitoring of serum potassium is underused. A deep-learning model that enables noninvasive hyperkalemia screening from the electrocardiogram (ECG) may improve detection of this life-threatening condition.

1,"Deep Learning-based Method for Fully Automatic Quantification of Left Ventricle Function from Cine MR Images: A Multivendor, Multicenter Study","Purpose To develop a deep learning-based method for fully automated quantification of left ventricular (LV) function from short-axis cine MR images and to evaluate its performance in a multivendor and multicenter setting. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included cine MRI data sets obtained from three major MRI vendors in four medical centers from 2008 to 2016. Three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the U-NET architecture were trained on data sets of increasing variability: (a) a single-vendor, single-center, homogeneous cohort of 100 patients (CNN1); (b) a single-vendor, multicenter, heterogeneous cohort of 200 patients (CNN2); and (c) a multivendor, multicenter, heterogeneous cohort of 400 patients (CNN3). All CNNs were tested on an independent multivendor, multicenter data set of 196 patients. CNN performance was evaluated with respect to the manual annotations from three experienced observers in terms of (a) LV detection accuracy, (b) LV segmentation accuracy, and (c) LV functional parameter accuracy. Automatic and manual results were compared with the paired Wilcoxon test, Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis. Results CNN3 achieved the highest performance on the independent testing data set. The average perpendicular distance compared with manual analysis was 1.1 mm +/- 0.3 for CNN3, compared with 1.5 mm +/- 1.0 for CNN1 (P < .05) and 1.3 mm +/- 0.6 for CNN2 (P < .05). The LV function parameters derived from CNN3 showed a high correlation (r(2) >/= 0.98) and agreement with those obtained by experts for data sets from different vendors and centers. Conclusion A deep learning-based method trained on a data set with high variability can achieve fully automated and accurate cine MRI analysis on multivendor, multicenter cine MRI data.

1,Fully convolutional multi-scale residual DenseNets for cardiac segmentation and automated cardiac diagnosis using ensemble of classifiers,"Deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based architectures have shown great potential in medical image segmentation. However, such architectures usually have millions of parameters and inadequate number of training samples leading to over-fitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we present a novel DenseNet based FCN architecture for cardiac segmentation which is parameter and memory efficient. We propose a novel up-sampling path which incorporates long skip and short-cut connections to overcome the feature map explosion in conventional FCN based architectures. In order to process the input images at multiple scales and view points simultaneously, we propose to incorporate Inception module's parallel structures. We propose a novel dual loss function whose weighting scheme allows to combine advantages of cross-entropy and Dice loss leading to qualitative improvements in segmentation. We demonstrate computational efficacy of incorporating conventional computer vision techniques for region of interest detection in an end-to-end deep learning based segmentation framework. From the segmentation maps we extract clinically relevant cardiac parameters and hand-craft features which reflect the clinical diagnostic analysis and train an ensemble system for cardiac disease classification. We validate our proposed network architecture on three publicly available datasets, namely: (i) Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC-2017), (ii) Left Ventricular segmentation challenge (LV-2011), (iii) 2015 Kaggle Data Science Bowl cardiac challenge data. Our approach in ACDC-2017 challenge stood second place for segmentation and first place in automated cardiac disease diagnosis tasks with an accuracy of 100% on a limited testing set (n=50). In the LV-2011 challenge our approach attained 0.74 Jaccard index, which is so far the highest published result in fully automated algorithms. In the Kaggle challenge our approach for LV volume gave a Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 0.0127, which would have placed us tenth in the original challenge. Our approach combined both cardiac segmentation and disease diagnosis into a fully automated framework which is computationally efficient and hence has the potential to be incorporated in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for clinical application.","Fully convolutional multi-scale residual DenseNets for cardiac segmentation and automated cardiac diagnosis using ensemble of classifiers.

1,Identifying facial phenotypes of genetic disorders using deep learning,"Syndromic genetic conditions, in aggregate, affect 8% of the population(1). Many syndromes have recognizable facial features(2) that are highly informative to clinical geneticists(3-5). Recent studies show that facial analysis technologies measured up to the capabilities of expert clinicians in syndrome identification(6-9). However, these technologies identified only a few disease phenotypes, limiting their role in clinical settings, where hundreds of diagnoses must be considered. Here we present a facial image analysis framework, DeepGestalt, using computer vision and deep-learning algorithms, that quantifies similarities to hundreds of syndromes. DeepGestalt outperformed clinicians in three initial experiments, two with the goal of distinguishing subjects with a target syndrome from other syndromes, and one of separating different genetic subtypes in Noonan syndrome. On the final experiment reflecting a real clinical setting problem, DeepGestalt achieved 91% top-10 accuracy in identifying the correct syndrome on 502 different images. The model was trained on a dataset of over 17,000 images representing more than 200 syndromes, curated through a community-driven phenotyping platform. DeepGestalt potentially adds considerable value to phenotypic evaluations in clinical genetics, genetic testing, research and precision medicine.","Identifying facial phenotypes of genetic disorders using deep learning.

1,A Deep Learning Mammography-based Model for Improved Breast Cancer Risk Prediction,"Background Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction. Purpose To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P < .05). Results The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years +/- 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P < .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01). Conclusion Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model.

1,Radiomic phenotypes of mammographic parenchymal complexity: Toward augmenting breast density in breast cancer risk assessment,"Purpose: To identify phenotypes of mammographic parenchymal complexity by using radiomic features and to evaluate their associations with breast density and other breast cancer risk factors. Materials and Methods: Computerized image analysis was used to quantify breast density and extract parenchymal texture features in a cross-sectional sample of women screened with digital mammography from September 1, 2012, to February 28, 2013 (n = 2029; age range, 35-75 years; mean age, 55.9 years). Unsupervised clustering was applied to identify and reproduce phenotypes of parenchymal complexity in separate training (n = 1339) and test sets (n = 690). Differences across phenotypes by age, body mass index, breast density, and estimated breast cancer risk were assessed by using Fisher exact, x2, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate preliminary associations between the detected phenotypes and breast cancer in an independent casecontrol sample (76 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 158 control participants) matched on age. Results: Unsupervised clustering in the screening sample identified four phenotypes with increasing parenchymal complexity that were reproducible between training and test sets (P = .001). Breast density was not strongly correlated with phenotype category (R2 = 0.24 for linear trend). The low- to intermediate-complexity phenotype (prevalence, 390 of 2029 [19%]) had the lowest proportion of dense breasts (eight of 390 [2.1%]), whereas similar proportions were observed across other phenotypes (from 140 of 291 [48.1%] in the high-complexity phenotype to 275 of 511 [53.8%] in the low-complexity phenotype). In the independent case-control sample, phenotypes showed a significant association with breast cancer (P = .001), resulting in higher discriminatory capacity when added to a model with breast density and body mass index (area under the curve, 0.84 vs 0.80; P = .03 for comparison). Conclusion: Radiomic phenotypes capture mammographic parenchymal complexity beyond conventional breast density measures and established breast cancer risk factors.","Radiomic phenotypes of mammographic parenchymal complexity: Toward augmenting breast density in breast cancer risk assessment.
