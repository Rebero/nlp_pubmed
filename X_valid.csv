"Substitution of venous for arterial blood sampling in the determination of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis with L-[1-11C]leucine PET: A validation study. We developed and validated a method to estimate input functions for determination of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with L-[1-11C]leucine PET without arterial sampling. The method is based on a population-derived input function (PDIF) approach, with venous samples for calibration. Population input functions were constructed from arterial blood data measured in 25 healthy 18â€“24-year-old males who underwent L-[1-11C]leucine PET scans while awake. To validate the approach, three additional groups of 18â€“27-year-old males underwent L-[1-11C]leucine PET scans with both arterial and venous blood sampling: 13 awake healthy volunteers, 10 sedated healthy volunteers, and 5 sedated subjects with fragile X syndrome. Rate constants of the L-[1-11C]leucine kinetic model were estimated voxel-wise with measured arterial input functions and with venous-calibrated PDIFs. Venous plasma leucine measurements were used with venous-calibrated PDIFs for rCPS computation. rCPS determined with PDIFs calibrated with 30â€“60 min venous samples had small errors (RMSE: 4â€“9%), and no statistically significant differences were found in any group when compared to rCPS determined with arterial input functions. We conclude that in young adult males, PDIFs calibrated with 30â€“60 min venous samples can be used in place of arterial input functions for determination of rCPS with L-[1-11C]leucine PET."
"Prediction of forelimb reach results from motor cortex activities based on calcium imaging and deep learning. Brain-wide activities revealed by neuroimaging and recording techniques have been used to predict motor and cognitive functions in both human and animal models. However, although studies have shown the existence of micrometer-scale spatial organization of neurons in the motor cortex relevant to motor control, two-photon microscopy (TPM) calcium imaging at cellular resolution has not been fully exploited for the same purpose. Here, we ask if calcium imaging data recorded by TPM in rodent brain can provide enough information to predict features of upcoming movement. We collected calcium imaging signal from rostral forelimb area in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex while mice performed a two-dimensional lever reaching task. Images of average calcium activity collected during motion preparation period and inter-trial interval (ITI) were used to predict the forelimb reach results. The evaluation was based on a deep learning model that had been applied for object recognition. We found that the prediction accuracy for both maximum reaching location and trial outcome based on motion preparation period but not ITI were higher than the probabilities governed by chance. Our study demonstrated that imaging data encompassing information on the spatial organization of functional neuronal clusters in the motor cortex is useful in predicting motor acts even in the absence of detailed dynamics of neural activities."
"Deep learning: new computational modelling techniques for genomics. As a data-driven science, genomics largely utilizes machine learning to capture dependencies in data and derive novel biological hypotheses. However, the ability to extract new insights from the exponentially increasing volume of genomics data requires more expressive machine learning models. By effectively leveraging large data sets, deep learning has transformed fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Now, it is becoming the method of choice for many genomics modelling tasks, including predicting the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory mechanisms such as DNA accessibility and splicing."
"Predicting the Debonding of CAD/CAM Composite Resin Crowns with AI. A preventive measure for debonding has not been established and is highly desirable to improve the survival rate of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite resin (CR) crowns. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of deep learning with a convolution neural network (CNN) method to predict the debonding probability of CAD/CAM CR crowns from 2-dimensional images captured from 3-dimensional (3D) stereolithography models of a die scanned by a 3D oral scanner. All cases of CAD/CAM CR crowns were manufactured from April 2014 to November 2015 at the Division of Prosthodontics, Osaka University Dental Hospital (Ethical Review Board at Osaka University, approval H27-E11). The data set consisted of a total of 24 cases: 12 trouble-free and 12 debonding as known labels. A total of 8,640 images were randomly divided into 6,480 training and validation images and 2,160 test images. Deep learning with a CNN method was conducted to develop a learning model to predict the debonding probability. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, receiver operating characteristic, and area under the curve of the learning model were assessed for the test images. Also, the mean calculation time was measured during the prediction for the test images. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values of deep learning with a CNN method for the prediction of the debonding probability were 98.5%, 97.0%, 100%, and 0.985, respectively. The mean calculation time was 2 ms/step for 2,160 test images. The area under the curve was 0.998. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology-that is, the deep learning with a CNN method established in this study-demonstrated considerably good performance in terms of predicting the debonding probability of a CAD/CAM CR crown with 3D stereolithography models of a die scanned from patients."
"EXTraction of EMR numerical data: an efficient and generalizable tool to EXTEND clinical research. BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMR) contain numerical data important for clinical outcomes research, such as vital signs and cardiac ejection fractions (EF), which tend to be embedded in narrative clinical notes. In current practice, this data is often manually extracted for use in research studies. However, due to the large volume of notes in datasets, manually extracting numerical data often becomes infeasible. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) tool that can efficiently extract numerical clinical data from narrative notes. RESULTS: To validate the accuracy of the tool EXTraction of EMR Numerical Data (EXTEND), we developed a reference standard by manually extracting vital signs from 285 notes, EF values from 300 notes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and serum creatinine from 890 notes. For each parameter of interest, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 score of EXTEND using two metrics. (1) completion of data extraction, and (2) accuracy of data extraction compared to the actual values in the note verified by chart review. At the note level, extraction by EXTEND was considered correct only if it accurately detected and extracted all values of interest in a note. Using manually-annotated labels as the gold standard, the note-level accuracy of EXTEND in capturing the numerical vital sign values, EF, HbA1C and creatinine ranged from 0.88 to 0.95 for sensitivity, 0.95 to 1.0 for specificity, 0.95 to 1.0 for PPV, 0.89 to 0.99 for NPV, and 0.92 to 0.96 in F1 scores. Compared to the actual value level, the sensitivity, PPV, and F1 score of EXTEND ranged from 0.91 to 0.95, 0.95 to 1.0 and 0.95 to 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: EXTEND is an efficient, flexible tool that uses knowledge-based rules to extract clinical numerical parameters with high accuracy. By increasing dictionary terms and developing new rules, the usage of EXTEND can easily be expanded to extract additional numerical data important in clinical outcomes research."
"Accurate and robust deep learning-based segmentation of the prostate clinical target volume in ultrasound images. The goal of this work was to develop a method for accurate and robust automatic segmentation of the prostate clinical target volume in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images for brachytherapy. These images can be difficult to segment because of weak or insufficient landmarks or strong artifacts. We devise a method, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that produces accurate segmentations on easy and difficult images alike. We propose two strategies to achieve improved segmentation accuracy on difficult images. First, for CNN training we adopt an adaptive sampling strategy, whereby the training process is encouraged to pay more attention to images that are difficult to segment. Secondly, we train a CNN ensemble and use the disagreement among this ensemble to identify uncertain segmentations and to estimate a segmentation uncertainty map. We improve uncertain segmentations by utilizing the prior shape information in the form of a statistical shape model. Our method achieves Hausdorff distance of 2.7+/-2.3 mm and Dice score of 93.9+/-3.5%. Comparisons with several competing methods show that our method achieves significantly better results and reduces the likelihood of committing large segmentation errors. Furthermore, our experiments show that our approach to estimating segmentation uncertainty is better than or on par with recent methods for estimation of prediction uncertainty in deep learning models. Our study demonstrates that estimation of model uncertainty and use of prior shape information can significantly improve the performance of CNN-based medical image segmentation methods, especially on difficult images."
"MySurgeryRisk: Development and Validation of a Machine-learning Risk Algorithm for Major Complications and Death After Surgery. OBJECTIVE: To accurately calculate the risk for postoperative complications and death after surgery in the preoperative period using machine-learning modeling of clinical data. BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications cause a 2-fold increase in the 30-day mortality and cost, and are associated with long-term consequences. The ability to precisely forecast the risk for major complications before surgery is limited. METHODS: In a single-center cohort of 51,457 surgical patients undergoing major inpatient surgery, we have developed and validated an automated analytics framework for a preoperative risk algorithm (MySurgeryRisk) that uses existing clinical data in electronic health records to forecast patient-level probabilistic risk scores for 8 major postoperative complications (acute kidney injury, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, intensive care unit admission >48 hours, mechanical ventilation >48 hours, wound, neurologic, and cardiovascular complications) and death up to 24 months after surgery. We used the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) and predictiveness curves to evaluate model performance. RESULTS: MySurgeryRisk calculates probabilistic risk scores for 8 postoperative complications with AUC values ranging between 0.82 and 0.94 [99% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.81-0.94]. The model predicts the risk for death at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months with AUC values ranging between 0.77 and 0.83 (99% CI 0.76-0.85). CONCLUSIONS: We constructed an automated predictive analytics framework for machine-learning algorithm with high discriminatory ability for assessing the risk of surgical complications and death using readily available preoperative electronic health records data. The feasibility of this novel algorithm implemented in real time clinical workflow requires further testing."
"Combined estimation of disease progression and retention on antiretroviral therapy among treated individuals with HIV in the USA: a modelling study. Background: Accurately estimating HIV disease progression and retention on antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help inform interventions to control HIV microepidemics and mathematical models used to inform health-resource allocation decisions. Our objective was to estimate the monthly probabilities of on-ART CD4 T-cell count progression, mortality, ART dropout, and ART reinitiation using a continuous-time multistate Markov model. We also aimed to validate health-state transition probability estimates to ensure they accurately reproduced the regional HIV microepidemics across the USA. Methods: In our modelling study, we considered a cohort of patients from the HIV Research Network, a consortium of 17 adult and paediatric HIV-care providers located in the northeastern (n=8), southern (n=5), and western (n=4) regions of the USA. Individuals aged 15 years or older who were in HIV care (defined as one CD4 test and one HIV-care visit in a calendar year period) with at least one ART prescription between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2015, were included in the analysis. We used continuous-time multistate Markov models to estimate transitions between CD4 strata and between on-ART and off-ART states. We examined and adjusted for differences in probability of transition by region, race or ethnicity, sex, HIV risk group, and other baseline clinical indicators. Findings: The median age of the 32 242 individuals included in the analysis was 44 years (interquartile range 35â€“51). Over a median follow-up of 4Â·9 years (2Â·6â€“6Â·0), 8614 (26Â·7%) of 32 242 people interrupted ART and 1325 (4Â·1%) of 32 242 people died. Women, men who have sex with men, and individuals with no previous ART experience had greater increases in CD4 cell counts, whereas black people and people who inject drugs had increased probabilities of ART dropout and faster disease progression. Regardless of CD4 strata, individuals had increased hazard for ART dropout if they were from the south (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] range from 1Â·91, 95% CI 1Â·71â€“2Â·13, to 2Â·45, 2Â·29â€“2Â·62) or the west (aHR range from 1Â·29, 1Â·10â€“1Â·51, to 1Â·66, 1Â·51â€“1Â·82) of the USA, compared with individuals from the northeast USA. Interpretation: Our results show heterogeneities in disease progression during ART and probability of ART retention across race and ethnicity, HIV risk groups, and regions. These differences should be viewed as targets for intervention and should be incorporated in mathematical models of regional HIV microepidemics in the USA. Funding: US National Institutes of Health, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and Health Resources and Services Administration."
"Machine Learning to Predict the Likelihood of Acute Myocardial Infarction. BACKGROUND: Variations in cardiac troponin concentrations by age, sex and time between samples in patients with suspected myocardial infarction are not currently accounted for in diagnostic approaches. We aimed to combine these variables through machine learning to improve the assessment of risk for individual patients. METHODS: A machine learning algorithm (myocardial-ischemic-injury-index [MI(3)]) incorporating age, sex, and paired high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations, was trained on 3,013 patients and tested on 7,998 patients with suspected myocardial infarction. MI(3) uses gradient boosting to compute a value (0-100) reflecting an individual's likelihood of a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction and estimates the sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for that individual. Assessment was by calibration and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). Secondary analysis evaluated example MI(3) thresholds from the training set that identified patients as low-risk (99% sensitivity) and high-risk (75% PPV), and performance at these thresholds was compared in the test set to the 99th percentile and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) rule-out pathways. RESULTS: Myocardial infarction occurred in 404 (13.4%) patients in the training set and 849 (10.6%) patients in the test set. MI(3) was well calibrated with a very high AUC of 0.963 [0.956-0.971] in the test set and similar performance in early and late presenters. Example MI(3) thresholds identifying low-risk and high-risk patients in the training set were 1.6 and 49.7 respectively. In the test set, MI(3) values were <1.6 in 69.5% with a NPV of 99.7% (99.5%-99.8%) and sensitivity of 97.8% (96.7-98.7%), and were >/=49.7 in 10.6% with a PPV of 71.8% (68.9-75.0%) and specificity of 96.7% (96.3-97.1%). Using these thresholds, MI(3) performed better than the ESC 0/3-hour pathway (sensitivity 82.5% [74.5-88.8%], specificity 92.2% [90.7-93.5%]) and the 99th percentile at any time-point (sensitivity 89.6% [87.4-91.6%]), specificity 89.3% [88.6-90.0%]). CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning, MI(3) provides an individualized and objective assessment of the likelihood of myocardial infarction, which can be used to identify low-risk and high-risk patients who may benefit from earlier clinical decisions.

"BUGSnet: an R package to facilitate the conduct and reporting of Bayesian network Meta-analyses. BACKGROUND: Several reviews have noted shortcomings regarding the quality and reporting of network meta-analyses (NMAs). We suspect that this issue may be partially attributable to limitations in current NMA software which do not readily produce all of the output needed to satisfy current guidelines. RESULTS: To better facilitate the conduct and reporting of NMAs, we have created an R package called ""BUGSnet"" (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct a Network meta-analysis). This R package relies upon Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) to conduct Bayesian NMA using a generalized linear model. BUGSnet contains a suite of functions that can be used to describe the evidence network, estimate a model and assess the model fit and convergence, assess the presence of heterogeneity and inconsistency, and output the results in a variety of formats including league tables and surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA) plots. We provide a demonstration of the functions contained within BUGSnet by recreating a Bayesian NMA found in the second technical support document composed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit (NICE-DSU). We have also mapped these functions to checklist items within current reporting and best practice guidelines. CONCLUSION: BUGSnet is a new R package that can be used to conduct a Bayesian NMA and produce all of the necessary output needed to satisfy current scientific and regulatory standards. We hope that this software will help to improve the conduct and reporting of NMAs."
"Digital pathology imaging and computer-aided diagnostics as a novel tool for standardization of evaluation of aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease) histopathology. Based on a recently introduced immunohistochemical panel (Bachmann et al. 2015) for aganglionic megacolon (AM), also known as Hirschsprung disease, histopathological diagnosis, we evaluated whether the use of digital pathology and â€˜machine learningâ€™ could help to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Slides were obtained from 31 specimens of 27 patients immunohistochemically stained for MAP2, calretinin, S100Î² and GLUT1. Slides were digitized by whole slide scanning. We used a Definiens Developer Tissue Studios as software for analysis. We configured necessary parameters in combination with â€˜machine learningâ€™ to identify pathological aberrations. A significant difference between AM- and non-AM-affected tissues was found for calretinin (AM 0.55% vs. non-AM 1.44%) and MAP2 (AM 0.004% vs. non-AM 0.07%) staining measurements and software-based evaluations. In contrast, S100Î² and GLUT1 staining measurements and software-based evaluations showed no significant differences between AM- and non-AM-affected tissues. However, no difference was found in comparison of suction biopsies with resections. Applying machine learning via an ensemble voting classifier, we achieved an accuracy of 87.5% on the test set. Automated diagnosis of AM by applying digital pathology on immunohistochemical panels was successful for calretinin and MAP2, whereas S100Î² and GLUT1 were not effective in diagnosis. Our method suggests that software-based approaches are capable of diagnosing AM. Our future challenge will be the improvement of efficiency by reduction of the time-consuming need for large pre-labelled training data. With increasing technical improvement, especially in unsupervised training procedures, this method could be helpful in the future."
"Estimating Retinal Sensitivity Using Optical Coherence Tomography With Deep-Learning Algorithms in Macular Telangiectasia Type 2. Importance: As currently used, microperimetry is a burdensome clinical testing modality for testing retinal sensitivity requiring long testing times and trained technicians. Objective: To create a deep-learning network that could directly estimate function from structure de novo to provide an en face high-resolution map of estimated retinal sensitivity. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional imaging study using data collected between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2017, from the Natural History Observation and Registry of macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) evaluated 38 participants with confirmed MacTel from 2 centers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean absolute error of estimated compared with observed retinal sensitivity. Observed retinal sensitivity was obtained with fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry). Estimates of retinal sensitivity were made with deep-learning models that learned on superpositions of high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and microperimetry results. Those predictions were used to create high-density en face sensitivity maps of the macula. Training, validation, and test sets were segregated at the patient level. Results: A total of 2499 microperimetry sensitivities were mapped onto 1708 OCT B-scans from 63 eyes of 38 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.3 [9.7] years; 15 men [39.5%]). The numbers of examples for our algorithm were 67â€¯899 (103â€¯053 after data augmentation) for training, 1695 for validation, and 1212 for testing. Mean absolute error results were 4.51 dB (95% CI, 4.36-4.65 dB) when using linear regression and 3.66 dB (95% CI, 3.53-3.78 dB) when using the LeNet model. Using a 49.9 million-variable deep-learning model, a mean absolute error of 3.36 dB (95% CI, 3.25-3.48 dB) of retinal sensitivity for validation and test was achieved. Correlation showed a high degree of agreement (Pearson correlation râ€‰=â€‰0.78). By paired Wilcoxon rank sum test, our model significantly outperformed these 2 baseline models (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Conclusions and Relevance: High-resolution en face maps of estimated retinal sensitivities were created in eyes with MacTel. The maps were of unequalled resolution compared with microperimetry and were able to correctly delineate functionally healthy and impaired retina. This model may be useful to monitor structural and functional disease progression and has potential as an objective surrogate outcome measure in investigational trials."
"Comparison of Machine Learning Methods with National Cardiovascular Data Registry Models for Prediction of Risk of Bleeding after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. Importance: Better prediction of major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may improve clinical decisions aimed to reduce bleeding risk. Machine learning techniques, bolstered by better selection of variables, hold promise for enhancing prediction. Objective: To determine whether machine learning techniques better predict post-PCI major bleeding compared with the existing National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) models. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used the NCDR CathPCI Registry data version 4.4 (July 1, 2009, to April 1, 2015), machine learning techniques were used (logistic regression with lasso regularization and gradient descent boosting [XGBoost, version 0.71.2]), and output was then compared with the existing simplified risk score and full NCDR models. The existing models were recreated, and then performance was evaluated through additional techniques and variables in a 5-fold cross-validation in analysis conducted from October 1, 2015, to October 27, 2017. The setting was retrospective modeling of a nationwide clinical registry of PCI. Participants were all patients undergoing PCI. Percutaneous coronary intervention procedures were excluded if they were not the index PCI of admission, if the hospital site had missing outcomes measures, or if the patient underwent subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting. Exposures: Clinical variables available at admission and diagnostic coronary angiography data were used to determine the severity and complexity of presentation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was in-hospital major bleeding within 72 hours after PCI. Results were evaluated by comparing C statistics, calibration, and decision threshold-based metrics, including the F score (harmonic mean of positive predictive value and sensitivity) and the false discovery rate. Results: The post-PCI major bleeding rate among 3316465 procedures (patients' median age, 65 years; interquartile range, 56-73 years; 68.1% male) was 4.5%. The existing full model achieved a mean C statistic of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.78-0.78). The use of XGBoost and full range of selected variables achieved a C statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.82-0.82), with an F score of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.30-0.31). XGBoost correctly identified an additional 3.7% of cases identified as high risk who experienced a bleeding event and an overall improvement of 1.0% of cases identified as low risk who did not experience a bleeding event. The data-driven decision threshold helped improve the false discovery rate of the existing techniques. The existing simplified risk score model improved the false discovery rate from more than 90% to 78.7%. Modifying the model and the data decision threshold improved this rate from 78.7% to 73.4%. Conclusions and Relevance: Machine learning techniques improved the prediction of major bleeding after PCI. These techniques may help to better identify patients who would benefit most from strategies to reduce bleeding risk."
"Six genes as potential diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma through data mining. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and the third of cancer mortality worldwide. Although the study of HCC has made great progress, the molecular mechanism and signal pathways of HCC are not yet clear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the early diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for HCC. The aim of this study is to screen the relevant genes and study the association of gene expression with the survival status of HCC patients using bioinformatics approaches, in the hope of establishing marker genes for diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. The gene expression data and corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were downloaded from the The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We performed to study the relationship between gene expression and prognosis of HCC and screen significantly relevant genes associated with prognosis of HCC by analyzing survival and function enrichment of genes. In this study, we collected 421 samples with gene expression data, including 371 tumor samples and 50 normal samples. By using single factor Cox regression analysis, we screened 1,197 genes significantly associated with survival time in the modeling data containing 117 samples and also searched six genes as the best markers to predict living status of HCC patients. Besides, we established score system of survival risk of HCC. Our study recognized six genes (PGBD3, PGM5P3-AS1, RNF5, UTP11, BAG6, and KCND2) to be significantly associated with diagnosis and prognosis of HCC, providing novel targets for studying potential mechanism about the progression of HCC."
"Changes in Whole Brain Dynamics and Connectivity Patterns during Sevoflurane- A nd Propofol-induced Unconsciousness Identified by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Editor's Perspective What We Already Know about This Topic The extent to which alterations within specific brain networks impairs communication among networks remains unknown What This Article Tells Us That Is New In a volunteer functional magnetic resonance study, general anesthesia reduced activity within and among networks Specific between-network connectivity is necessary for consciousness Background: A key feature of the human brain is its capability to adapt flexibly to changing external stimuli. This capability can be eliminated by general anesthesia, a state characterized by unresponsiveness, amnesia, and (most likely) unconsciousness. Previous studies demonstrated decreased connectivity within the thalamus, frontoparietal, and default mode networks during general anesthesia. We hypothesized that these alterations within specific brain networks lead to a change of communication between networks and their temporal dynamics. Methods: We conducted a pooled spatial independent component analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from 16 volunteers during propofol and 14 volunteers during sevoflurane general anesthesia that have been previously published. Similar to previous studies, mean z-scores of the resulting spatial maps served as a measure of the activity within a network. Additionally, correlations of associated time courses served as a measure of the connectivity between networks. To analyze the temporal dynamics of between-network connectivity, we computed the correlation matrices during sliding windows of 1 min and applied k-means clustering to the matrices during both general anesthesia and wakefulness. Results: Within-network activity was decreased in the default mode, attentional, and salience networks during general anesthesia (P < 0.001, range of median changes:-0.34,-0.13). Average between-network connectivity was reduced during general anesthesia (P < 0.001, median change:-0.031). Distinct between-network connectivity patterns for both wakefulness and general anesthesia were observed irrespective of the anesthetic agent (P < 0.001), and there were fewer transitions in between-network connectivity patterns during general anesthesia (P < 0.001, median number of transitions during wakefulness: 4 and during general anesthesia: 0). Conclusions: These results suggest that (1) higher-order brain regions play a crucial role in the generation of specific between-network connectivity patterns and their dynamics, and (2) the capability to interact with external stimuli is represented by complex between-network connectivity patterns."
"Selective organ ischaemia/reperfusion identifies liver as the key driver of the post-injury plasma metabolome derangements. Background. Understanding the molecular mechanisms in perturbation of the metabolome following ischaemia and reperfusion is critical in developing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent the sequelae of post-injury shock. While the metabolic substrates fueling these alterations have been defined, the relative contribution of specific organs to the systemic metabolic reprogramming secondary to ischaemic or haemorrhagic hypoxia remains unclear. Materials and methods. A porcine model of selected organ ischaemia was employed to investigate the relative contribution of liver, kidney, spleen and small bowel ischaemia/reperfusion to the plasma metabolic phenotype, as gleaned through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Results. Liver ischaemia/reperfusion promotes glycaemia, with increases in circulating carboxylic acid anions and purine oxidation metabolites, suggesting that this organ is the dominant contributor to the accumulation of these metabolites in response to ischaemic hypoxia. Succinate, in particular, accumulates selectively in response to the hepatic ischemia, with levels 6.5 times spleen, 8.2 times small bowel, and 6 times renal levels. Similar trends, but lower fold-change increase in comparison to baseline values, were observed upon ischaemia/reperfusion of kidney, spleen and small bowel. Discussion. These observations suggest that the liver may play a critical role in mediating the accumulation of the same metabolites in response to haemorrhagic hypoxia, especially with respect to succinate, a metabolite that has been increasingly implicated in the coagulopathy and pro-inflammatory sequelae of ischaemic and haemorrhagic shock."
"Training the next generation of Africa's doctors: why medical schools should embrace the team-based learning pedagogy. BACKGROUND: As far back as 1995, the Cape Town Declaration on training Africa's future doctor recognized the need for medical schools to adopt active-learning strategies in order to nurture holistic development of the doctor. However, medical education in Africa remains largely stuck with traditional pedagogies that emphasize the 'hard skills' such as knowledge and clinical acumen while doing little to develop 'soft skills' such as effective communication, teamwork, critical thinking or life-long learning skills. By reviewing literature on Africa's epidemiologic and demographic transitions, we establish the need for increasing the output of well-trained doctors in order to match the continent's complex current and future healthcare needs. Challenges that bedevil African medical education such as outdated curricula, limited educational infrastructure and chronic resource constraints are presented and discussed. Furthermore, increased student enrollments, a trend observed at many schools, coupled with chronic faculty shortages have inadvertently presented specific barriers against the success of small-group active-learning strategies such as Problem-Based and Case-Based Learning. We argue that Team-Based Learning (TBL) offers a robust alternative for delivering holistic medical education in the current setting. TBL is instructor-driven and embodies key attributes that foster development of both 'hard' and 'soft' skills. We elaborate on advantages that TBL is likely to bring to the African medical education landscape, including increased learner enthusiasm and creativity, accountability, peer mentorship, deep learning and better knowledge retention. As with all new pedagogical methods, challenges anticipated during initial implementation of TBL are discussed followed by the limited pilot experiences with TBL in Africa. CONCLUSION: For its ability to enable a student-centered, active learning experience delivered at minimum cost, we encourage individual instructors and African medical schools at large, to adopt TBL as a complementary strategy towards realizing the goal of training Africa's fit-for-purpose doctor."
"Assessment of risk based on variant pathways and establishment of an artificial neural network model of thyroid cancer. Background: This study aimed to establish an artificial neural network (ANN) model based on variant pathways to predict the risk of thyroid cancer. Methods: The RNASeq data of 482 thyroid cancer samples were downloaded from the TCGA database. The samples were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups, followed by identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Co-expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were then performed. The variant pathways were screened according to the functional deviation score of each pathway, and an ANN model was established. Finally, the efficiency of the ANN model for risk assessment was validated by survival analysis and analysis of an independent microarray dataset (GSE34289) for thyroid cancer. Results: In total, 190 DEGs (85 up-regulated and 105 down-regulated) were identified between the low-risk and high-risk groups. Ten risk-related variant pathways were identified between the low-risk and high-risk groups, which were related to inflammatory and immune responses. Based on these variant pathways, an ANN model was built, consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer, corresponding to 15, 8, 5, and 1 neuron, respectively. Survival analysis showed that this model could effectively distinguish the samples with different risks. Analysis of microarray dataset GSE34289 showed that the accuracy of this model for predicating low-risk and high-risk samples was 77.5 and 86.0%, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that the ANN model based on variant pathways can be used for effectively evaluating the risk of thyroid cancer."
"Using poster presentation to assess large classes: a case study of a first-year undergraduate module at a South African university. BACKGROUND: The massification of higher education is often associated with poor student engagement, poor development of their critical thinking, inadequate feedback and poor student throughput. These factors necessitate the need to devise novel, innovative methods to teach, assess and provide feedback to learners to counter the restrictions imposed due to the large class learning environments. This study was conducted to ascertain the perceptions of 1st year medical students and staff at the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine regarding the value of poster presentations as a strategy to enhance learning, assessment and feedback. METHODS: This was an exploratory observational, descriptive cross-sectional, case study. Data was collected through separate student and staff questionnaires that required participant responses on a five-point Likert scale. The data was extracted into Excel spreadsheets for quantitative analysis. RESULTS: Two-hundred- and-thirty (92%) student questionnaires were returned (NÂ =â€‰250). Most students indicated that the design and presentation of the poster had helped them to select important material (92%), understand and describe disadvantage (86%) and to make a difference in the community (92%). The students agreed that the poster assessment was an efficient (81%) and fair method (75%) that provided opportunities for meaningful feedback. Ten staff members responded to the questionnaire. Most staff members (90%) indicated that the poster presentation had allowed students to demonstrate their engagement in a meaningful and appropriate way around issues of disadvantage and HIV and agreed that the poster presentations allowed for immediate and effective feedback. CONCLUSION: Students' interactions in the tasks promoted active engagement with others and course material; the development of higher order thinking and skills which added to students' accounts of transformative learning experiences. They could describe and illustrate the difference that they had made in their chosen community. The poster presentations allowed for quick and efficient marking, immediate feedback and an opportunity to validate the students' participation. Poster presentations offered an innovative way to encourage deep meaningful engagement and learning amongst peers and facilitators. Poster presentations should be more widely considered as an innovative way of encouraging deeper engagement and learning in a large class setting."
"Deep Learning-Assisted Diagnosis of Cerebral Aneurysms Using the HeadXNet Model. Importance: Deep learning has the potential to augment clinician performance in medical imaging interpretation and reduce time to diagnosis through automated segmentation. Few studies to date have explored this topic. Objective: To develop and apply a neural network segmentation model (the HeadXNet model) capable of generating precise voxel-by-voxel predictions of intracranial aneurysms on head computed tomographic angiography (CTA) imaging to augment clinicians' intracranial aneurysm diagnostic performance. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network architecture was developed using a training set of 611 head CTA examinations to generate aneurysm segmentations. Segmentation outputs from this support model on a test set of 115 examinations were provided to clinicians. Between August 13, 2018, and October 4, 2018, 8 clinicians diagnosed the presence of aneurysm on the test set, both with and without model augmentation, in a crossover design using randomized order and a 14-day washout period. Head and neck examinations performed between January 3, 2003, and May 31, 2017, at a single academic medical center were used to train, validate, and test the model. Examinations positive for aneurysm had at least 1 clinically significant, nonruptured intracranial aneurysm. Examinations with hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, posttraumatic or infectious pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, surgical clips, coils, catheters, or other surgical hardware were excluded. All other CTA examinations were considered controls. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, time, and interrater agreement were measured. Metrics for clinician performance with and without model augmentation were compared. Results: The data set contained 818 examinations from 662 unique patients with 328 CTA examinations (40.1%) containing at least 1 intracranial aneurysm and 490 examinations (59.9%) without intracranial aneurysms. The 8 clinicians reading the test set ranged in experience from 2 to 12 years. Augmenting clinicians with artificial intelligence-produced segmentation predictions resulted in clinicians achieving statistically significant improvements in sensitivity, accuracy, and interrater agreement when compared with no augmentation. The clinicians' mean sensitivity increased by 0.059 (95% CI, 0.028-0.091; adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), mean accuracy increased by 0.038 (95% CI, 0.014-0.062; adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.02), and mean interrater agreement (Fleiss Îº) increased by 0.060, from 0.799 to 0.859 (adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.05). There was no statistically significant change in mean specificity (0.016; 95% CI, -0.010 to 0.041; adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.16) and time to diagnosis (5.71 seconds; 95% CI, 7.22-18.63 seconds; adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰.19). Conclusions and Relevance: The deep learning model developed successfully detected clinically significant intracranial aneurysms on CTA. This suggests that integration of an artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostic model may augment clinician performance with dependable and accurate predictions and thereby optimize patient care."
"The Chylomicronemia Syndrome Is Most Often Multifactorial: A Narrative Review of Causes and Treatment. The chylomicronemia syndrome occurs when triglyceride levels are severely elevated (usually >16.95 mmol/L [1500 mg/dL]) and is characterized by such clinical features as abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, eruptive xanthomas, and lipemia retinalis. It may result from 1 of 3 conditions: the presence of secondary forms of hypertriglyceridemia concurrent with genetic causes of hypertriglyceridemia, termed multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MFCS); a deficiency in the enzyme lipoprotein lipase and some associated proteins, termed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS); or familial partial lipodystrophy. Most chylomicronemia syndrome cases are the result of MFCS; FCS is very rare. In all these conditions, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins accumulate because of impaired plasma clearance. This review describes the 3 major causes of the chylomicronemia syndrome; their consequences; and the approaches to treatment, which differ considerably by group."
"AI-Assisted Forward Modeling of Biological Structures. The rise of machine learning and deep learning technologies have allowed researchers to automate image classification. We describe a method that incorporates automated image classification and principal component analysis to evaluate computational models of biological structures. We use a computational model of the kinetochore to demonstrate our artificial-intelligence (AI)-assisted modeling method. The kinetochore is a large protein complex that connects chromosomes to the mitotic spindle to facilitate proper cell division. The kinetochore can be divided into two regions: the inner kinetochore, including proteins that interact with DNA; and the outer kinetochore, comprised of microtubule-binding proteins. These two kinetochore regions have been shown to have different distributions during metaphase in live budding yeast and therefore act as a test case for our forward modeling technique. We find that a simple convolutional neural net (CNN) can correctly classify fluorescent images of inner and outer kinetochore proteins and show a CNN trained on simulated, fluorescent images can detect difference in experimental images. A polymer model of the ribosomal DNA locus serves as a second test for the method. The nucleolus surrounds the ribosomal DNA locus and appears amorphous in live-cell, fluorescent microscopy experiments in budding yeast, making detection of morphological changes challenging. We show a simple CNN can detect subtle differences in simulated images of the ribosomal DNA locus, demonstrating our CNN-based classification technique can be used on a variety of biological structures."
"Improving rare disease classification using imperfect knowledge graph. BACKGROUND: Accurately recognizing rare diseases based on symptom description is an important task in patient triage, early risk stratification, and target therapies. However, due to the very nature of rare diseases, the lack of historical data poses a great challenge to machine learning-based approaches. On the other hand, medical knowledge in automatically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs) has the potential to compensate the lack of labeled training examples. This work aims to develop a rare disease classification algorithm that makes effective use of a knowledge graph, even when the graph is imperfect. METHOD: We develop a text classification algorithm that represents a document as a combination of a ""bag of words"" and a ""bag of knowledge terms,"" where a ""knowledge term"" is a term shared between the document and the subgraph of KG relevant to the disease classification task. We use two Chinese disease diagnosis corpora to evaluate the algorithm. The first one, HaoDaiFu, contains 51,374 chief complaints categorized into 805 diseases. The second data set, ChinaRe, contains 86,663 patient descriptions categorized into 44 disease categories. RESULTS: On the two evaluation data sets, the proposed algorithm delivers robust performance and outperforms a wide range of baselines, including resampling, deep learning, and feature selection approaches. Both classification-based metric (macro-averaged F1 score) and ranking-based metric (mean reciprocal rank) are used in evaluation. CONCLUSION: Medical knowledge in large-scale knowledge graphs can be effectively leveraged to improve rare diseases classification models, even when the knowledge graph is incomplete."
"Evidential MACE prediction of acute coronary syndrome using electronic health records. BACKGROUND: Major adverse cardiac event (MACE) prediction plays a key role in providing efficient and effective treatment strategies for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during their hospitalizations. Existing prediction models have limitations to cope with imprecise and ambiguous clinical information such that clinicians cannot reach to reliable MACE prediction results for individuals. METHODS: To remedy it, this study proposes a hybrid method using Rough Set Theory (RST) and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence. In details, four state-of-the-art models, including one traditional ACS risk scoring model, i.e., GRACE, and three machine learning based models, i.e., Support Vector Machine, L1-Logistic Regression, and Classification and Regression Tree, are employed to generate initial MACE prediction results, and then RST is applied to determine the weights of the four single models. After that, the acquired prediction results are assumed as basic beliefs for the problem propositions and in this way, an evidential prediction result is generated based on DST in an integrative manner. RESULTS: Having applied the proposed method on a clinical dataset consisting of 2930 ACS patient samples, our model achieves 0.715 AUC value with competitive standard deviation, which is the best prediction results comparing with the four single base models and two baseline ensemble models. CONCLUSIONS: Facing with the limitations in traditional ACS risk scoring models, machine learning models and the uncertainties of EHR data, we present an ensemble approach via RST and DST to alleviate this problem. The experimental results reveal that our proposed method achieves better performance for the problem of MACE prediction when compared with the single models."
"Molecular mechanisms of lineage decisions in metabolite-specific T cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) recognize the microbial metabolite 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-d-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU) presented by the MHC class Ib molecule, MR1. MAIT cells acquire effector functions during thymic development, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the developmental path of 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes. In addition to the known MAIT1 and MAIT17 effector subsets selected on bone-marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, we identified 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes that were selected on thymic epithelial cells and differentiated into CD44âˆ’ naive T cells. MAIT cell positive selection required signaling through the adapter, SAP, that controlled the expression of the transcription factor, ZBTB16. Pseudotemporal ordering of single cells revealed transcriptional trajectories of 5-OP-RU-specific thymocytes selected on either thymic epithelial cells or hematopoietic cells. The resulting model illustrates T cell lineage decisions."
"Fast and accurate bacterial species identification in urine specimens using LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and machine learning. Fast identification of microbial species in clinical samples is essential to provide an appropriate antibiotherapy to the patient and reduce the prescription of broad-spectrum antimicrobials leading to antibioresistances. MALDITOF- MS technology has become a tool of choice for microbial identification but has several drawbacks: It requires a long step of bacterial culture before analysis (>24 h), has a low specificity and is not quantitative. We developed a new strategy for identifying bacterial species in urine using specific LC-MS/MS peptidic signatures. In the first training step, libraries of peptides are obtained on pure bacterial colonies in DDA mode, their detection in urine is then verified in DIA mode, followed by the use of machine learning classifiers (NaiveBayes, BayesNet and Hoeffding tree) to define a peptidic signature to distinguish each bacterial species from the others. Then, in the second step, this signature is monitored in unknown urine samples using targeted proteomics. This method, allowing bacterial identification in less than 4 h, has been applied to fifteen species representing 84% of all Urinary Tract Infections. More than 31,000 peptides in 190 samples were quantified by DIA and classified by machine learning to determine an 82 peptides signature and build a prediction model. This signature was validated for its use in routine using Parallel Reaction Monitoring on two different instruments. Linearity and reproducibility of the method were demonstrated as well as its accuracy on donor specimens. Within 4h and without bacterial culture, our method was able to predict the predominant bacteria infecting a sample in 97% of cases and 100% above the standard threshold. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our method for the rapid and specific identification of the bacterial species causing UTI and could be extended in the future to other biological specimens and to bacteria having specific virulence or resistance factors."
"Comparative assessment of CNN architectures for classification of breast FNAC images. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) entails using a narrow gauge (25-22 G) needle to collect a sample of a lesion for microscopic examination. It allows a minimally invasive, rapid diagnosis of tissue but does not preserve its histological architecture. FNAC is commonly used for diagnosis of breast cancer, with traditional practice being based on the subjective visual assessment of the breast cytopathology cell samples under a microscope to evaluate the state of various cytological features. Therefore, there are many challenges in maintaining consistency and reproducibility of findings. However, the advent of digital imaging and computational aid in diagnosis can improve the diagnostic accuracy and reduce the effective workload of pathologists. This paper presents a comparison of various deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based fine-tuned transfer learned classification approach for the diagnosis of the cell samples. The proposed approach has been tested using VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50 and GoogLeNet-V3 (aka Inception V3) architectures of CNN on an image dataset of 212 images (99 benign and 113 malignant), later augmented and cleansed to 2120 images (990 benign and 1130 malignant), where the network was trained using images of 80% cell samples and tested on the rest. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the models giving a new dimension to FNAC study where GoogLeNet-V3 (fine-tuned) achieved an accuracy of 96.25% which is highly satisfactory."
"High-spatial-resolution diffusion MRI in Parkinson disease: Lateral asymmetry of the substantia nigra. Background: Motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) have exhibited lateral asymmetry, suggesting asymmetric neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN). Diffusion MRI may be able to help confirm tissue microstructural alterations in the substantia nigra to probe for the presence of asymmetry. Purpose: To investigate lateral asymmetry in the SN of patients with PD by using diffusion MRI with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted from March 2015 to March 2017, 27 participants with PD and 27 age-matched healthy control (HC) participants, all right handed, underwent MRI at 3.0 T. High-spatial-resolution diffusion images were acquired with a reduced field of view by using seven b values up to 3000 sec/mm2. A continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) non-Gaussian diffusion model was used to produce anomalous diffusion coefficient (Dm) and temporal (a) and spatial (b) diffusion heterogeneity indexes followed by a Gaussian diffusion model to yield an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Individual or linear combinations of diffusion parameters in the SN were unilaterally and bilaterally compared between the PD and HC groups. Results: In the bilateral comparison between the PD and HC groups, differences were observed in b (0.67 6 0.06 [standard deviation] vs 0.64 6 0.04, respectively; P = .016), ADC (0.48 mm2/msec 6 0.08 vs 0.53 mm2/msec 6 0.06, respectively; P = .03), and the combination of CTRW parameters (P = .02). In the unilateral comparison, differences were observed in all diffusion parameters on the left SN (P , .03), but not on the right (P . .20). In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to delineate left SN abnormality in PD, the combination of Dm, a, and b produced the best sensitivity (sensitivity, 0.78); the combination of Dm and b produced the best specificity (specificity, 0.85); and the combination of a and b produced the largest area under the ROC curve (area under the ROC curve, 0.73). Conclusion: These results suggest that quantitative diffusion MRI is sensitive to brain tissue changes in participants with Parkinson disease and provide evidence of substantia nigra lateral asymmetry in this disease."
"Multi-Dimensional Screening Strategy for Drug Repurposing with Statistical Framework-A New Road to Influenza Drug discovery. Influenza virus is known for its intermittent outbreaks affecting billions of people worldwide. Several neuraminidase inhibitors have been used in practice to overcome this situation. However, advent of new resistant mutants has limited its clinical utilization. In the recent years drug repurposing technique has attained the limelight as it is cost effective and reduces the time consumed for drug discovery. Here, we present multi-dimensional repurposing strategy that integrates the results of ligand-, energy-, receptor cavity, and shape-based pharmacophore algorithm to effectively identify novel drug candidate for influenza. The pharmacophore hypotheses were generated by utilizing the PHASE module of SchrÃ¶dinger. The generated hypotheses such as AADP, AADDD, and DDRRNH, respectively, for ligand-, e-pharmacophore and receptor cavity based approach alongside shape of oseltamivir were successfully utilized to screen the DrugBank database. Subsequently, these models were evaluated for their differentiating ability using Enrichment calculation. Receiver operating curve and enrichment factors from the analysis indicate that the models possess better capability to screen actives from decoy set of molecules. Eventually, the hits retrieved from different hypotheses were subjected to molecular docking using Glide module of SchrÃ¶dinger Suite. The results of different algorithms were then combined to eliminate false positive hits and to demonstrate reliable prediction performance than existing approaches. Of note, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the extent of correlation between the glide score and IC50 values. Further, the interaction profile, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics properties were analyzed for the hit compounds. The results from our analysis showed that alprostadil (DB00770) exhibits better binding affinity toward NA protein than the existing drug molecules. The biological activity of the hit was also predicted using PASS algorithm that renders the antiviral activity of the compound. Further, the results were validated using mutation analysis and molecular dynamic simulation studies. Indeed, this integrative filtering is able to exceed accuracy of other state-of-the-art methods for the drug discovery."
"Combination of peri- and intratumoral radiomic features on baseline CT scans predicts response to chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma. Purpose: To identify the role of radiomics texture features both within and outside the nodule in predicting (a) time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) as well as (b) response to chemotherapy in patients with nonâ€“small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods: Data in a total of 125 patients who had been treated with pemetrexed-based platinum doublet chemotherapy at Cleveland Clinic were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided randomly into two sets with the constraint that there were an equal number of responders and nonresponders in the training set. The training set comprised 53 patients with NSCLC, and the validation set comprised 72 patients. A machine learning classifier trained with radiomic texture features extracted from intra- and peritumoral regions of nonâ€“contrast-enhanced CT images was used to predict response to chemotherapy. The radiomic risk-score signature was generated by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with the Cox regression model; association of the radiomic signature with TTP and OS was also evaluated. Results: A combination of radiomic features in conjunction with a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier yielded a mean maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82 Â± 0.09 (standard deviation) in the training set and a corresponding AUC of 0.77 in the independent testing set. The radiomics signature was also significantly associated with TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95, 4.00; P <.0001) and OS (HR, 2.35; 95% CI: 1.41, 3.94; P =.0011). Additionally, decision curve analysis demonstrated that in terms of clinical usefulness, the radiomics signature had a higher overall net benefit in prediction of high-risk patients to receive treatment than the clinicopathologic measurements. Conclusion: This study suggests that radiomic texture features extracted from within and around the nodule on baseline CT scans are (a) predictive of response to chemotherapy and (b) associated with TTP and OS for patients with NSCLC."
"Covalent Docking Identifies a Potent and Selective MKK7 Inhibitor. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is central to the cell response to stress, inflammatory signals, and toxins. While selective inhibitors are known for JNKs and for various upstream MAP3Ks, no selective inhibitor is reported for MKK7â€“â€“one of two direct MAP2Ks that activate JNK. Here, using covalent virtual screening, we identify selective MKK7 covalent inhibitors. We optimized these compounds to low-micromolar inhibitors of JNK phosphorylation in cells. The crystal structure of a lead compound bound to MKK7 demonstrated that the binding mode was correctly predicted by docking. We asserted the selectivity of our inhibitors on a proteomic level and against a panel of 76 kinases, and validated an on-target effect using knockout cell lines. Lastly, we show that the inhibitors block activation of primary mouse B cells by lipopolysaccharide. These MKK7 tool compounds will enable better investigation of JNK signaling and may serve as starting points for therapeutics."
"Lack of Association Between CTLA-4 Genetic Polymorphisms and Noncardiac Gastric Cancer in a Chinese Population. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a key negative immunoregulatory molecule with characteristics of gene polymorphisms. Genetically predisposed CTLA-4 alteration in humans was associated with gastric cancer (GC) development. To explore the association of CTLA-4 polymorphism with susceptibility of noncardiac GC (NCGC), 490 NCGC patients and 1476 control individuals were studied. Four CTLA-4 polymorphisms were genotyped with SNPscan genotyping assays and the haplotypes were constructed with SHESIS software. Frequencies of the CTLA-4 haplotypes were estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm. The CTLA-4 polymorphism genotype distribution and allele frequencies were not significantly different between the NCGC patients and the control subjects. The CTLA-4 haplotypes did not exhibit a significantly increased risk for NCGC patients. Adjusting status of age, sex, smoking status, alcohol use, and body mass index could not moderate any of the relationships. Data suggested that CTLA-4 polymorphisms (rs3087243, rs16840252, rs733618, and rs231775) were not significantly associated with the risk of NCGC in this Chinese population studied."
"MiR-181c-5p exacerbates hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via targeting PTPN4. Background. Activation of cell apoptosis is a major form of cell death during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI). Therefore, examining ways to control cell apoptosis has important clinical significance for improving postischemic recovery. Clinical evidence demonstrated that miR-181c-5p was significantly upregulated in the early phase of myocardial infarction. However, whether or not miR-181c-5p mediates cardiac I/RI through cell apoptosis pathway is unknown. Thus, the present study is aimed at investigating the role and the possible mechanism of miR-181c-5p in apoptosis during I/R injury by using H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Methods and Results. The rat origin H9C2 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R, 6 hours hypoxia followed by 6 hours reoxygenation) to induce cell injury. The results showed that H/R significantly increased the expression of miR-181c-5p but not miR-181c-3p in H9C2 cells. In line with this, in an in vivo rat cardiac I/RI model, miR-181c-5p expression was also significantly increased. The overexpression of miR-181c-5p by its agomir transfection significantly aggravated H/R-induced cell injury (increased lactate dehydrogenase level and reduced cell viability) and exacerbated H/R-induced cell apoptosis (greater cleaved caspases 3 expression, Bax/Bcl-2 and more TUNEL-positive cells). In contrast, inhibition of miR-181c-5p in vitro had the opposite effect. By using computational prediction algorithms, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 4 (PTPN4) was predicted as a potential target gene of miR-181c-5p and was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. The overexpression of miR-181c-5p significantly attenuated the mRNA and protein expression of PTPN4 in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Moreover, knockdown of PTPN4 significantly aggravated H/R-induced enhancement of LDH level, cleaved caspase 3 expression, and apoptotic cell death, which mimicked the proapoptotic effects of miR-181c-5p in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Conclusions. These findings suggested that miR-181c-5p exacerbates H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury and apoptosis via targeting PTPN4 and that miR-181c-5p/PTPN4 signaling may yield novel strategies to combat myocardial I/R injury."
"Whole Blood Transcriptome Analysis for Lifelong Monitoring in Elite Sniffer Dogs Produced by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer. Reproductive cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a valuable method to propagate service dogs with desirable traits because of higher selection rates in cloned dogs. However, incomplete reprogramming is a major barrier to SCNT, and the assessment of reprogramming is limited to preimplantation embryos and tissues from dead and/or adult tissue. Thus, lifelong monitoring in SCNT dogs can be useful to evaluate the SCNT service dogs for propagation. We applied microarray and qRT-PCR to profile of mRNA and miRNA in whole blood samples collected from four cloned dogs (S), three age-matched control dogs (A), and a donor dog (D). In the analysis of differentially expressed genes in S-A, A-D, and S-D pairs, most genomes were completely reprogrammed and rejuvenated in the cloned offspring. However, several RNAs were differentially expressed. Interestingly, the altered genes are associated with aging and senescence. Furthermore, we identified potential biomarkers such as mirR-223 (NFIB; CLIC4), miRN-494 (ARHGEF12), miR-106b (PPP1R3B; CC2D1A), miR-20a (CC2D1A; PPP1R3B), miR-30e (IGJ; HIRA), and miR-19a (TNRC6A) by miRNA-target mRNA pairing for monitoring rejuvenation, aging/senescence, and reprogramming in cloned dogs. The novel comparative transcriptomic information about SCNT and age-matched dogs can be used to assess the lifelong health of cloned dogs and to facilitate the selection of training animals with minimal invasive procedures."
"Equalization of four cardiovascular risk algorithms after systematic recalibration: individual-participant meta-analysis of 86 prospective studies. AIMS: There is debate about the optimum algorithm for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation. We conducted head-to-head comparisons of four algorithms recommended by primary prevention guidelines, before and after 'recalibration', a method that adapts risk algorithms to take account of differences in the risk characteristics of the populations being studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using individual-participant data on 360 737 participants without CVD at baseline in 86 prospective studies from 22 countries, we compared the Framingham risk score (FRS), Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), pooled cohort equations (PCE), and Reynolds risk score (RRS). We calculated measures of risk discrimination and calibration, and modelled clinical implications of initiating statin therapy in people judged to be at 'high' 10 year CVD risk. Original risk algorithms were recalibrated using the risk factor profile and CVD incidence of target populations. The four algorithms had similar risk discrimination. Before recalibration, FRS, SCORE, and PCE over-predicted CVD risk on average by 10%, 52%, and 41%, respectively, whereas RRS under-predicted by 10%. Original versions of algorithms classified 29-39% of individuals aged >/=40 years as high risk. By contrast, recalibration reduced this proportion to 22-24% for every algorithm. We estimated that to prevent one CVD event, it would be necessary to initiate statin therapy in 44-51 such individuals using original algorithms, in contrast to 37-39 individuals with recalibrated algorithms. CONCLUSION: Before recalibration, the clinical performance of four widely used CVD risk algorithms varied substantially. By contrast, simple recalibration nearly equalized their performance and improved modelled targeting of preventive action to clinical need."
"Efficient method for isolation of reticulocyte RNA from healthy individuals and hemolytic anaemia patients. Despite enormous progress and development of high-throughput methods in genome-wide mRNA analyses, data on the erythroid transcriptome are still limited, even though they could be useful in medical diagnostics and personalized therapy as well as in research on normal and pathological erythroid maturation. Although obtaining normal and pathological reticulocyte transcriptome profiles should contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular bases of terminal erythroid differentiation as well as the mechanisms of the hematological diseases, a basic limitation of these studies is the difficulty of efficient reticulocyte RNA isolation from human peripheral blood. The restricted number of possible parallel experiments primarily concern healthy individuals with the lowest number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood and a low RNA content. In the present study, an efficient method for reticulocyte RNA isolation from healthy individuals and hemolytic anaemia patients is presented. The procedure includes leukofiltration, Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation, Percoll gradient centrifugation, and negative (CD45 and CD61) immunomagnetic separation. This relatively fast and simple four-stage method was successfully applied to obtain a reticulocyte-rich population from healthy subjects, which was used to efficiently isolate the high-quality RNA essential for successful NGS-based transcriptome analysis."
"A Transcriptome-wide Translational Program Defined by LIN28B Expression Level. Tan et al. show that changes in LIN28B expression can upregulate and downregulate gene expression. By suppressing let-7 family miRNA biogenesis, LIN28B liberates Argonaute to bind non-let-7 miRNA families with greater frequency, causing downstream changes because of redistributed miRNA activity. These effects affect a significant portion of the transcriptome."
"Common brain disorders are associated with heritable patterns of apparent aging of the brain. Common risk factors for psychiatric and other brain disorders are likely to converge on biological pathways influencing the development and maintenance of brain structure and function across life. Using structural MRI data from 45,615 individuals aged 3-96 years, we demonstrate distinct patterns of apparent brain aging in several brain disorders and reveal genetic pleiotropy between apparent brain aging in healthy individuals and common brain disorders."
"A data-driven approach to predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease with machine learning. BACKGROUND: Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the main causes of death in the United States. Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data contributing to these diseases among the patients. METHODS: Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models. RESULTS: The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131 variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory results. In diabetes classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data) and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in diabetes patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported weight, 4) leg length, and 5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2) systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported weight, 4) occurrence of chest pain, and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors. CONCLUSION: We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We also identify key contributors to the prediction, which can be further explored for their implications on electronic health records."
"Improved homology modeling of the human & rat EP4 prostanoid receptors. Background: The EP4 prostanoid receptor is one of four GPCRs that mediate the diverse actions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Novel selective EP4 receptor agonists would assist to further elucidate receptor sub-type function and promote development of therapeutics for bone healing, heart failure, and other receptor associated conditions. The rat EP4 (rEP4) receptor has been used as a surrogate for the human EP4 (hEP4) receptor in multiple SAR studies. To better understand the validity of this traditional approach, homology models were generated by threading for both receptors using the RaptorX server. These models were fit to an implicit membrane using the PPM server and OPM database with refinement of intra and extracellular loops by Prime (SchrÃ¶dinger). To understand the interaction between the receptors and known agonists, induced-fit docking experiments were performed using Glide and Prime (SchrÃ¶dinger), with both endogenous agonists and receptor sub-type selective, small-molecule agonists. The docking scores and observed interactions were compared with radioligand displacement experiments and receptor (rat & human) activation assays monitoring cAMP. Results: Rank-ordering of in silico compound docking scores aligned well with in vitro activity assay EC50 and radioligand binding Ki. We observed variations between rat and human EP4 binding pockets that have implications in future small-molecule receptor-modulator design and SAR, specifically a S103G mutation within the rEP4 receptor. Additionally, these models helped identify key interactions between the EP4 receptor and ligands including PGE2 and several known sub-type selective agonists while serving as a marked improvement over the previously reported models. Conclusions: This work has generated a set of novel homology models of the rEP4 and hEP4 receptors. The homology models provide an improvement upon the previously reported model, largely due to improved solvation. The hEP4 docking scores correlates best with the cAMP activation data, where both data sets rank order Rivenprost>CAY10684 > PGE1 â‰ˆ PGE2 > 11-deoxy-PGE1 â‰ˆ 11-dexoy-PGE2 > 8-aza-11-deoxy-PGE1. This rank-ordering matches closely with the rEP4 receptor as well. Species-specific differences were noted for the weak agonists Sulprostone and Misoprostol, which appear to dock more readily within human receptor versus rat receptor."
"Quality-based UnwRap of SUbdivided Large Arrays (URSULA) for high-resolution MRI data. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mapping of the static magnetic field and the magnetic susceptibility is based on multidimensional phase measurements. Phase data are ambiguous and have to be unwrapped to their true range in order to exhibit a correct representation of underlying features. High-resolution imaging at ultra-high fields, where susceptibility and phase contrast are natural tools, can generate large datasets, which tend to dramatically increase computing time demands for spatial unwrapping algorithms. This article describes a novel method, URSULA, which introduces an artificial volume compartmentalisation that allows large-scale unwrapping problems to be broken down, making URSULA ideally suited for computational parallelisation. In the presented study, URSULA is illustrated with a quality-guided unwrapping approach. Validation is performed on numerical data and an application on a high-resolution measurement, at the clinical field strength of 3T is demonstrated. In conclusion, URSULA allows for a reduction of the problem size, a substantial speed-up and for handling large data sets without sacrificing the overall accuracy of the resulting phase information."
"Artificial intelligence estimates the importance of baseline factors in predicting response to anti-PD1 in metastatic melanoma. Objective: Prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma has dramatically improved over recent years because of the advent of antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1). However, the response rate is 40% and baseline biomarkers for the outcome are yet to be identified. Here, we aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence might be useful in weighting the importance of baseline variables in predicting response to anti-PD1. Methods: This is a retrospective study evaluating 173 patients receiving anti-PD1 for melanoma. Using an artificial neuronal network analysis, the importance of different variables was estimated and used in predicting response rate and overall survival. Results: After a mean follow-up of 12.8 (Â±11.9) months, disease control rate was 51%. Using artificial neuronal network, we observed that 3 factors predicted response to anti-PD1: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (importance: 0.195), presence of â‰¥3 metastatic sites (importance: 0.156), and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > upper limit of normal (importance: 0.154). Looking at connections between different covariates and overall survival, the most important variables influencing survival were: presence of â‰¥3 metastatic sites (importance: 0.202), age (importance: 0.189), NLR (importance: 0.164), site of primary melanoma (cutaneous vs. noncutaneous) (importance: 0.112), and LDH > upper limit of normal (importance: 0.108). Conclusions: NLR, presence of â‰¥3 metastatic sites, LDH levels, age, and site of primary melanoma are important baseline factors influencing response and survival. Further studies are warranted to estimate a model to drive the choice to administered anti-PD1 treatments in patients with melanoma."
"Evaluating the role of RAD52 and its interactors as novel potential molecular targets for hepatocellular carcinoma. Background: Radiation sensitive 52 (RAD52) is an important protein that mediates DNA repair in tumors. However, little is known about the impact of RAD52 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the expression of RAD52 and its values in HCC. Some proteins that might be coordinated with RAD52 in HCC were also analyzed. Methods: Global RAD52 mRNA levels in HCC were assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. RAD52 expression was analyzed in 70 HCC tissues and adjacent tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of over-expressed RAD52 in Huh7 HCC cells was investigated. The String database was then used to perform enrichment and functional analysis of RAD52 and its interactome. Cytoscape software was used to create a protein-protein interaction network. Molecular interaction studies with RAD52 and its interactome were performed using the molecular docking tools in Hex8.0.0. Finally, these DNA repair proteins, which interact with RAD52, were also analyzed using the TCGA dataset and were detected by qRT-PCR. Based on the TCGA database, algorithms combining ROC between RAD52 and RAD52 interactors were used to diagnose HCC by binary logistic regression. Results: In TCGA, upregulated RAD52 related to gender was obtained in HCC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of RAD52 was 0.704. The results of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) indicated no difference in the prognosis between patients with high and low RAD52 gene expression. We validated that RAD52 expression was increased at the mRNA and protein levels in Chinese HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Higher RAD52 was associated with older age, without correlation with other clinicopathological factors. In vitro, over-expressed RAD52 significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of Huh7 cells. Furthermore, RAD52 interactors (radiation sensitive 51, RAD51; X-ray repair cross complementing 6, XRCC6; Cofilin, CFL1) were also increased in HCC and participated in some biological processes with RAD52. Protein structure analysis showed that RAD52-RAD51 had the firmest binding structure with the lowest E-total energy (- 1120.5 kcal/mol) among the RAD52-RAD51, RAD52-CFL1, and RAD52-XRCC6 complexes. An algorithm combining ROC between RAD52 and its interactome indicated a greater specificity and sensitivity for HCC screening. Conclusions: Overall, our study suggested that RAD52 plays a vital role in HCC pathogenesis and serves as a potential molecular target for HCC diagnosis and treatment. This study's findings regarding the multigene prediction and diagnosis of HCC are valuable."
"Impact of a decreasing pre-test probability on the performance of diagnostic tests for coronary artery disease. Aims: To provide a pooled estimation of contemporary pre-test probabilities (PTPs) of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) across clinical patient categories, re-evaluate the utility of the application of diagnostic techniques according to such estimates, and propose a comprehensive diagnostic technique selection tool for suspected CAD. Methods and results: Estimates of significant CAD prevalence across sex, age, and type of chest pain categories from three large-scale studies were pooled (n = 15 815). The updated PTPs and diagnostic performance profiles of exercise electrocardiogram, invasive coronary angiography, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), positron emission tomography (PET), stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and SPECT were integrated to define the PTP ranges in which ruling-out CAD is possible with a post-test probability of <10% and <5%. These ranges were then integrated in a new colour-coded tabular diagnostic technique selection tool. The Bayesian relationship between PTP and the rate of diagnostic false positives was explored to complement the characterization of their utility. Pooled CAD prevalence was 14.9% (range = 1-52), clearly lower than that used in current clinical guidelines. Ruling-out capabilities of non-invasive imaging were good overall. The greatest ruling-out capacity (i.e. post-test probability <5%) was documented by CCTA, PET, and stress CMR. With decreasing PTP, the fraction of false positive findings rapidly increased, although a lower CAD prevalence partially cancels out such effect. Conclusion: The contemporary PTP of significant CAD across symptomatic patient categories is substantially lower than currently assumed. With a low prevalence of the disease, non-invasive testing can rarely rule-in the disease and focus should shift to ruling-out obstructive CAD. The large proportion of false positive findings must be taken into account when patients with low PTP are investigated."
"Bisecting GlcNAc is a general suppressor of terminal modification of N-glycan. Glycoproteins are decorated with complex glycans for protein functions. However, regulation mechanisms of complex glycan biosynthesis are largely unclear. Here we found that bisecting GlcNAc, a branching sugar residue in N-glycan, suppresses the biosynthesis of various types of terminal epitopes in N-glycans, including fucose, sialic acid and human natural killer-1. Expression of these epitopes in N-glycan was elevated in mice lacking the biosynthetic enzyme of bisecting GlcNAc, GnT-III, and was conversely suppressed by GnT-III overexpression in cells. Many glycosyltransferases for N-glycan terminals were revealed to prefer a nonbisected N-glycan as a substrate to its bisected counterpart, whereas no up-regulation of their mRNAs was found. This indicates that the elevated expression of the terminal N-glycan epitopes in GnT-III-deficient mice is attributed to the substrate specificity of the biosynthetic enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed that nonbisected glycans were preferentially accepted by those glycosyltransferases. These findings unveil a new regulation mechanism of protein N-glycosylation."
"LI-RADS Treatment Response Algorithm: Performance and Diagnostic Accuracy. Background In 2017, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) included an algorithm for the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with local-regional therapy. The aim of the algorithm was to enable standardized evaluation of treatment response to guide subsequent therapy. However, the performance of the algorithm has not yet been validated in the literature. Purpose To evaluate the performance of the LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm for assessing the histopathologic viability of HCC treated with bland arterial embolization. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent bland arterial embolization for HCC between 2006 and 2016 and subsequent liver transplantation. Three radiologists independently assessed all treated lesions by using the CT/MRI LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm. Radiology and posttransplant histopathology reports were then compared. Lesions were categorized on the basis of explant pathologic findings as either completely (100%) or incompletely (<100%) necrotic, and performance characteristics and predictive values for the LI-RADS Treatment Response (LR-TR) Viable and Nonviable categories were calculated for each reader. Interreader association was calculated by using the Fleiss kappa. Results A total of 45 adults (mean age, 57.1 years +/- 8.2; 13 women) with 63 total lesions were included. For predicting incomplete histopathologic tumor necrosis, the accuracy of the LR-TR Viable category for the three readers was 60%-65%, and the positive predictive value was 86%-96%. For predicting complete histopathologic tumor necrosis, the accuracy of the LR-TR Nonviable category was 67%-71%, and the negative predictive value was 81%-87%. By consensus, 17 (27%) of 63 lesions were categorized as LR-TR Equivocal, and 12 of these lesions were incompletely necrotic. Interreader association for the LR-TR category was moderate (kappa = 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.67). Conclusion The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System 2017 Treatment Response algorithm had high predictive value and moderate interreader association for the histopathologic viability of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with bland arterial embolization when lesions were assessed as Viable or Nonviable.

"CHASMplus Reveals the Scope of Somatic Missense Mutations Driving Human Cancers. Tokheim et al. introduce a computational approach to accurately separate driver from passenger mutations in cancer. Their analysis revealed that most driver mutations occur only in a few patients, presenting a challenge for precision medicine, and several cancer types will benefit from additional sequencing to identify these rare driver mutations."
"Combination of active transfer learning and natural language processing to improve liver volumetry using surrogate metrics with deep learning. Purpose: To determine if weakly supervised learning with surrogate metrics and active transfer learning can hasten clinical deployment of deep learning models. Materials and Methods: By leveraging Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge 2017 public data (n = 131 studies), natural language processing of reports, and an active learning method, a model was trained to segment livers on 239 retrospectively collected portal venous phase abdominal CT studies obtained between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016. Absolute volume differences between predicted and originally reported liver volumes were used to guide active learning and assess accuracy. Overall survival based on liver volumes predicted by this model (n = 34 patients) versus radiology reports and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with sodium (MELD-Na) scores was assessed. Differences in absolute liver volume were compared by using the paired Student t test, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation; survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and a Mantel-Cox test. Results: Data from patients with poor liver volume prediction (n = 10) with a model trained only with publicly available data were incorporated into an active learning method that trained a new model (LiTS data plus over-and underestimated active learning cases [LiTS-OU]) that performed significantly better on a held-out institutional test set (absolute volume difference of 231 vs 176 mL, P =.0005). In overall survival analysis, predicted liver volumes using the best active learning-trained model (LiTS-OU) were at least comparable with liver volumes extracted from radiology reports and MELD-Na scores in predicting survival. Conclusion: Active transfer learning using surrogate metrics facilitated deployment of deep learning models for clinically meaningful liver segmentation at a major liver transplant center."
"A draft map of the human ovarian proteome for tissue engineering and clinical applications. Fertility preservation research in women today is increasingly taking advantage of bioengineering techniques to develop new biomimetic materials and solutions to safeguard ovarian cell function and microenvironment in vitro and in vivo. However, available data on the human ovary are limited and fundamental differences between animal models and humans are hampering researchers in their quest for more extensive knowledge of human ovarian physiology and key reproductive proteins that need to be preserved. We therefore turned to multi-dimensional label-free mass spectrometry to analyze human ovarian cortex, as it is a high-throughput and conclusive technique providing information on the proteomic composition of complex tissues like the ovary. In-depth proteomic profiling through two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, Western blotting, histological and immunohistochemical analyses, and data mining helped us to confidently identify 1508 proteins. Moreover, our method allowed us to chart the most complete representation so far of the ovarian matrisome, defined as the ensemble of extracellular matrix proteins and associated factors, including more than 80 proteins. In conclusion, this study will provide a better understanding of ovarian proteomics, with a detailed characterization of the ovarian follicle microenvironment, in order to enable bioengineers to create biomimetic scaffolds for transplantation and three-dimensional in vitro culture. By publishing our proteomic data, we also hope to contribute to accelerating biomedical research into ovarian health and disease in general.

"Identification of a 26-lncRNAs Risk Model for Predicting Overall Survival of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis. As a common malignancy in women, cervical squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) can function as potential biomarkers in cancer prognosis; however, little is known about its role in cervical cancer. In this study, we downloaded the gene expression profiles along with the clinical data of patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By applying bioinformatics analysis including random forest selection and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) cox regression model along with 10-fold cross-validation, we constructed a 26-lncRNAs risk model that can be used to predict the overall survival of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. After that, Kaplan-Meier analysis combined with log-rank p test was applied to assess the predictive accuracy of the 26-lncRNAs risk model. Further analysis showed that the prognostic value of 26-lncRNAs risk model was independent of other clinicopathological factors. At last, lncRNAs in the model were put into gene ontology biological process enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways analysis, which suggested that these lncRNAs might contribute to cancer-associated processes such as cell cycle and apoptosis. This study indicated that lncRNAs signature could be a useful marker to predict the prognosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma."
"Mammographic Breast Density Assessment Using Deep Learning: Clinical Implementation. Purpose To develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to assess mammographic breast density. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to assess Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density based on the original interpretation by an experienced radiologist of 41 479 digital screening mammograms obtained in 27 684 women from January 2009 to May 2011. The resulting algorithm was tested on a held-out test set of 8677 mammograms in 5741 women. In addition, five radiologists performed a reader study on 500 mammograms randomly selected from the test set. Finally, the algorithm was implemented in routine clinical practice, where eight radiologists reviewed 10 763 consecutive mammograms assessed with the model. Agreement on BI-RADS category for the DL model and for three sets of readings-(a) radiologists in the test set, (b) radiologists working in consensus in the reader study set, and (c) radiologists in the clinical implementation set-were estimated with linear-weighted kappa statistics and were compared across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess significance. Results The DL model showed good agreement with radiologists in the test set (kappa = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.68) and with radiologists in consensus in the reader study set (kappa = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.82). There was very good agreement (kappa = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.86) with radiologists in the clinical implementation set; for binary categorization of dense or nondense breasts, 10 149 of 10 763 (94%; 95% CI: 94%, 95%) DL assessments were accepted by the interpreting radiologist. Conclusion This DL model can be used to assess mammographic breast density at the level of an experienced mammographer. (c) RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article .

"Association of Early Interventions with Birth Outcomes and Child Linear Growth in Low-Income and Middle-Income Countries: Bayesian Network Meta-analyses of Randomized Clinical Trials. Importance: The first 1000 days of life represent a critical window for child development. Pregnancy, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) period (0-6 months), and complementary feeding (CF) period (6-24 months) have different growth requirements, so separate considerations for intervention strategies are needed. No synthesis to date has attempted to quantify the associations of interventions under multiple domains of micronutrient and balanced energy protein and food supplements, deworming, maternal education, water sanitation, and hygiene across these 3 life periods with birth and growth outcomes. Objective: To determine the magnitude of association of interventions with birth and growth outcomes based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) using Bayesian network meta-analyses. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from their inception up to August 14, 2018. Study Selection: Included were LMIC-based RCTs of interventions provided to pregnant women, infants (0-6 months), and children (6-24 months). Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers used a standardized data extraction and quality assessment form. Random-effects network meta-analyses were performed for each life period. Effect sizes are reported as odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MeanDiffs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). This study calculated probabilities of interventions being superior to standard of care by at least a minimal clinically important difference. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study compared ORs on preterm birth and MeanDiffs on birth weight for pregnancy, length for age (LAZ) for EBF, and height for age (HAZ) for CF. Results: Among 302 061 participants in 169 randomized clinical trials, the network meta-analyses found several nutritional interventions that demonstrated greater association with improved birth and growth outcomes compared with standard of care. For instance, compared with standard of care, maternal supplements of multiple micronutrients showed reduced odds for preterm birth (OR, 0.54; 95% CrI, 0.27-0.97) and improved mean birth weight (MeanDiff, 0.08 kg; 95% CrI, 0.00-0.17 kg) but not LAZ during EBF (MeanDiff, -0.02; 95% CrI, -0.18 to 0.14). Supplementing infants and children with multiple micronutrients showed improved LAZ (MeanDiff, 0.20; 95% CrI, 0.03-0.35) and HAZ (MeanDiff, 0.14; 95% CrI, 0.02-0.25). The study found that pregnancy interventions generally had higher probabilities of a minimal clinically importance difference than the interventions for the EBF or CF in the first 1000 days of life. Conclusions and Relevance: These analyses highlight the importance of intervening early for child development, during pregnancy if possible. Results of this study suggest that there is a need to combine interventions from multiple domains and test for their effectiveness as a package.."
"Using artificial intelligence to reduce diagnostic workload without compromising detection of urinary tract infections. BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of microbiological screening in diagnostic laboratories is due to suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs), yet approximately two thirds of urine samples typically yield negative culture results. By reducing the number of query samples to be cultured and enabling diagnostic services to concentrate on those in which there are true microbial infections, a significant improvement in efficiency of the service is possible. METHODOLOGY: Screening process for urine samples prior to culture was modelled in a single clinical microbiology laboratory covering three hospitals and community services across Bristol and Bath, UK. Retrospective analysis of all urine microscopy, culture, and sensitivity reports over one year was used to compare two methods of classification: a heuristic model using a combination of white blood cell count and bacterial count, and a machine learning approach testing three algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting) whilst factoring in independent variables including demographics, historical urine culture results, and clinical details provided with the specimen. RESULTS: A total of 212,554 urine reports were analysed. Initial findings demonstrated the potential for using machine learning algorithms, which outperformed the heuristic model in terms of relative workload reduction achieved at a classification sensitivity >â€‰95%. Upon further analysis of classification sensitivity of subpopulations, we concluded that samples from pregnant patients and children (age 11 or younger) require independent evaluation. First the removal of pregnant patients and children from the classification process was investigated but this diminished the workload reduction achieved. The optimal solution was found to be three Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms, trained independently for the classification of pregnant patients, children, and then all other patients. When combined, this system granted a relative workload reduction of 41% and a sensitivity of 95% for each of the stratified patient groups. CONCLUSION: Based on the considerable time and cost savings achieved, without compromising the diagnostic performance, the heuristic model was successfully implemented in routine clinical practice in the diagnostic laboratory at Severn Pathology, Bristol. Our work shows the potential application of supervised machine learning models in improving service efficiency at a time when demand often surpasses resources of public healthcare providers."
"Predicting hospital-acquired pneumonia among schizophrenic patients: a machine learning approach. BACKGROUND: Medications are frequently used for treating schizophrenia, however, anti-psychotic drug use is known to lead to cases of pneumonia. The purpose of our study is to build a model for predicting hospital-acquired pneumonia among schizophrenic patients by adopting machine learning techniques. METHODS: Data related to a total of 185 schizophrenic in-patients at a Taiwanese district mental hospital diagnosed with pneumonia between 2013 ~â€‰2018 were gathered. Eleven predictors, including gender, age, clozapine use, drug-drug interaction, dosage, duration of medication, coughing, change of leukocyte count, change of neutrophil count, change of blood sugar level, change of body weight, were used to predict the onset of pneumonia. Seven machine learning algorithms, including classification and regression tree, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, naÃ¯ve Bayes, random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression were utilized to build predictive models used in this study. Accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa were used to measure overall model performance. RESULTS: Among the seven adopted machine learning algorithms, random forest and decision tree exhibited the optimal predictive accuracy versus the remaining algorithms. Further, six most important risk factors, including, dosage, clozapine use, duration of medication, change of neutrophil count, change of leukocyte count, and drug-drug interaction, were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Although schizophrenic patients remain susceptible to the threat of pneumonia whenever treated with anti-psychotic drugs, our predictive model may serve as a useful support tool for physicians treating such patients."
"Development and validation of an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma detection model by large-scale microrna profiling. IMPORTANCE Patients with late-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have a poor prognosis. Noninvasive screening tests using serum microRNAs (miRNAs) to accurately detect earlystage ESCC are needed to improve mortality. OBJECTIVE To establish a model using serum miRNAs to distinguish patients with ESCC from noncancer controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this case-control study, serum miRNA expression profiles of patients with ESCC (n = 566) and control patients without cancer (n = 4965) were retrospectively analyzed to establish a diagnostic model, which was tested in a training set and confirmed in a validation set. Patients histologically diagnosed as having ESCC who did not receive prior therapy or have a past or concurrent cancer other than ESCC were enrolled from the National Cancer Center Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Between October 2010 and November 2015, control samples were collected from the National Cancer Center Biobank, the Biobank of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, and the general population undergoing routine health examination. Data analysis was performed between August 2015 and October 2018. Serum samples were randomly divided into discovery and validation sets. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The expression of 2565 miRNAs was assessed in each sample. The discriminant model (named the EC index) was evaluated in the training set using Fisher linear discriminant analysis with a greedy algorithm. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the diagnostic ability of the model in the validation set. RESULTS In the training set, 283 patients with esophageal cancer (median age, 67 years [range, 37-90 years]; 83.4%male) were compared with 283 control patients (median age, 54 years [range, 22-100 years]; 43.1%male), and the EC index was constructed using 6 miRNAs (miR-8073, miR-6820-5p, miR-6794-5p, miR-3196, miR-744-5p, and miR-6799-5p). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curvewas 1.00, with sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 0.98. The validation set included 283 patients (median age, 66 years [range, 42-87 years]; 83.0%male) and 4682 control patients (median age, 68 years [range, 20-98 years]; 44.7%male), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the EC index was 1.00, with sensitivity of 0.96 and specificity of 0.98. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE What appears to be novel serum miRNA discriminant model was developed for the diagnosis of ESCC. A multicenter prospective study is ongoing to confirm the present observations."
"Deep learning can predict microsatellite instability directly from histology in gastrointestinal cancer. Microsatellite instability determines whether patients with gastrointestinal cancer respond exceptionally well to immunotherapy. However, in clinical practice, not every patient is tested for MSI, because this requires additional genetic or immunohistochemical tests. Here we show that deep residual learning can predict MSI directly from H&E histology, which is ubiquitously available. This approach has the potential to provide immunotherapy to a much broader subset of patients with gastrointestinal cancer."
"Development and validation of machine learning models in prediction of remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease. IMPORTANCE Biological therapies have revolutionized inflammatory bowel disease management, but many patients do not respond to biological monotherapy. Identification of likely responders could reduce costs and delays in remission. OBJECTIVE To identify patients with Crohn disease likely to be durable responders to ustekinumab before committing to long-term treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study analyzed data from 3 phase 3 randomized clinical trials (UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI) conducted from 2011 to 2015. Participants (n = 401) were individuals with active (C-reactive protein [CRP] measurement of_5mg/L at enrollment) Crohn disease who received ustekinumab therapy. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2017, to June 1, 2018. EXPOSURES All included patients were exposed to 1 or more dose of ustekinumab for 8 weeks or more. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Random forest methods were used in building 2 models for predicting Crohn disease remission, with a CRP level lower than 5mg/dL as a proxy for biological remission, beyond week 42 of ustekinumab treatment. The first model used only baseline data, and the second used data through week 8. RESULTS In total, 401 participants, with a mean (SD) age of 36.3 (12.6) years and 170 male (42.4%), were included. Theweek-8 model had a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.78 (95%CI, 0.69-0.87). In the testing data set, 27 of 55 participants (49.1%) classified as likely to have treatment success achieved success with a CRP level lower than 5mg/L after week 42, and 7 of 65 participants (10.8%) classified as likely to have treatment failure achieved this outcome. In the full cohort, 87 patients (21.7%) attained remission after week 42. A prediction model using the week-6 albumin to CRP ratio had an AUROC of 0.76 (95%CI, 0.71-0.82). Baseline ustekinumab serum levels did not improve the model's prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with active Crohn disease, demographic and laboratory data before week 8 of treatment appeared to allow the prompt identification of likely nonresponders to ustekinumab without the need for costly drug-level monitoring."
"Deep learning-based prescription of cardiac MRI planes. Purpose: To develop and evaluate a system to prescribe imaging planes for cardiac MRI based on deep learning (DL)âˆ’based localization of key anatomic landmarks. Materials and Methods: Annotated landmarks on 892 long-axis (LAX) and 493 short-axis (SAX) cine steady-state free precession series from cardiac MR images were retrospectively collected between February 2012 and June 2017. U-Net-based heatmap regression was used for localization of cardiac landmarks, which were used to compute cardiac MRI planes. Performance was evaluated by comparing localization distances and plane angle differences between DL predictions and ground truth. The plane angulations from DL were compared with those prescribed by the technologist at the original time of acquisition. Data were split into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and results confirmed with fivefold cross-validation. Results: On LAX images, DL localized the apex within mean 12.56 mm Â± 19.11 (standard deviation) and the mitral valve (MV) within 7.68 mm Â± 6.91. On SAX images, DL localized the aortic valve within 5.78 mm Â± 5.68, MV within 5.90 mm Â± 5.24, pulmonary valve within 6.55 mm Â± 6.39, and tricuspid valve within 6.39 mm Â± 5.89. On the basis of these localizations, average angle bias and mean error of DL-predicted imaging planes relative to ground truth annotations were as follows: SAX, âˆ’1.27Â° Â± 6.81 and 4.93Â° Â± 4.86; four chambers, 0.38Â° Â± 6.45 and 5.16Â° Â± 3.80; three chambers, 0.13Â° Â± 12.70 and 9.02Â° Â± 8.83; and two chamber, 0.25Â° Â± 9.08 and 6.53Â° Â± 6.28, respectively. Conclusion: DL-based anatomic localization is a feasible strategy for planning cardiac MRI planes. This approach can produce imaging planes comparable to those defined by ground truth landmarks."
"The ai-2/luxsquorum sensing system affects the growth characteristics, biofilm formation, and virulence of haemophilus parasuis. Haemophilus parasuis (H. parasuis) is a kind of opportunistic pathogen of the upper respiratory tract of piglets. Under certain circumstances, virulent strains can breach the mucosal barrier and enter the bloodstream, causing severe GlÃ¤sser's disease. Many virulence factors are found to be related to the pathogenicity of H. parasuis strain, but the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. LuxS/AI-2, as a kind of very important quorum sensing system, affects the growth characteristics, biofilm formation, antibiotic production, virulence, and metabolism of different strains. In order to investigate the effect of luxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system on the virulence of H. parasuis, a deletion mutant strain (luxS) and complemented strain (C-luxS) were constructed and characterized. The results showed that the luxS gene participated in regulating and controlling stress resistance, biofilm formation and virulence. Compared with wild-Type strain, luxS strain decreased the production of AI-2 molecules and the tolerance toward oxidative stress and heat shock, and it reduced the abilities of autoagglutination, hemagglutination, and adherence, whereas it increased the abilities to form biofilm in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that luxS strain attenuated its virulence about 10-folds and significantly decreased its tissue burden of bacteria in mice, compared with the wild-Type strain. Taken together, the luxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system in H. parasuis not only plays an important role in growth and biofilm formation, but also affects the pathogenicity of H. parasuis."
"Automated profiling of growth cone heterogeneity defines relations between morphology and motility. Growth cones are complex, motile structures at the tip of an outgrowing neurite. They often exhibit a high density of filopodia (thin actin bundles), which complicates the unbiased quantification of their morphologies by software. Contemporary image processing methods require extensive tuning of segmentation parameters, require significant manual curation, and are often not sufficiently adaptable to capture morphology changes associated with switches in regulatory signals. To overcome these limitations, we developed Growth Cone Analyzer (GCA). GCA is designed to quantify growth cone morphodynamics from time-lapse sequences imaged both in vitro and in vivo, but is sufficiently generic that it may be applied to nonneuronal cellular structures. We demonstrate the adaptability of GCA through the analysis of growth cone morphological variation and its relation to motility in both an unperturbed system and in the context of modified Rho GTPase signaling. We find that perturbations inducing similar changes in neurite length exhibit underappreciated phenotypic nuance at the scale of the growth cone."
"A machine learning model to predict hepatocellular carcinoma response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Purpose: To evaluate a fully automated machine learning algorithm that uses pretherapeutic quantitative CT image features and clinical factors to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Materials and Methods: Outcome information from 105 patients receiving first-line treatment with TACE was evaluated retrospectively. The primary clinical endpoint was time to progression (TTP) based on follow-up CT radiologic criteria (modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). A 14-week cutoff was used to classify patients as TACE-susceptible (TTP 14 weeks) or TACE-refractory (TTP, 14 weeks). Response to TACE was predicted using a random forest classifier with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage and quantitative image features as input, as well as the BCLC stage alone as a control. Results: The modelâ€™s response prediction accuracy rate was 74.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64%, 82%) using a combination of the BCLC stage plus quantitative image features versus 62.9% (95% CI: 52%, 72%) using the BCLC stage alone. Shape image features of the tumor and background liver were the dominant features correlated to the TTP as selected by the Boruta method and were used to predict the outcome. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrated that quantitative image features obtained prior to therapy can improve the accuracy of predicting response of HCC to TACE. This approach is likely to provide useful information for aiding in selection of patients with HCC for TACE."
"Cortical pain processing in the rat anterior cingulate cortex and primary somatosensory cortex. Pain is a complex multidimensional experience encompassing sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational and cognitive-emotional components mediated by different neural mechanisms. Investigations of neurophysiological signals from simultaneous recordings of two or more cortical circuits may reveal important circuit mechanisms on cortical pain processing. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) represent two most important cortical circuits related to sensory and affective processing of pain. Here, we recorded in vivo extracellular activity of the ACC and S1 simultaneously from male adult Sprague-Dale rats (n = 5), while repetitive noxious laser stimulations were delivered to animalÃµs hindpaw during pain experiments. We identified spontaneous pain-like events based on stereotyped pain behaviors in rats. We further conducted systematic analyses of spike and local field potential (LFP) recordings from both ACC and S1 during evoked and spontaneous pain episodes. From LFP recordings, we found stronger phase-amplitude coupling (theta phase vs. gamma amplitude) in the S1 than the ACC (n = 10 sessions), in both evoked (p = 0.058) and spontaneous pain-like behaviors (p = 0.017, paired signed rank test). In addition, pain-modulated ACC and S1 neuronal firing correlated with the amplitude of stimulus-induced event-related potentials (ERPs) during evoked pain episodes. We further designed statistical and machine learning methods to detect pain signals by integrating ACC and S1 ensemble spikes and LFPs. Together, these results reveal differential coding roles between the ACC and S1 in cortical pain processing, as well as point to distinct neural mechanisms between evoked and putative spontaneous pain at both LFP and cellular levels."
"A guide to deep learning in healthcare. Here we present deep-learning techniques for healthcare, centering our discussion on deep learning in computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and generalized methods. We describe how these computational techniques can impact a few key areas of medicine and explore how to build end-to-end systems. Our discussion of computer vision focuses largely on medical imaging, and we describe the application of natural language processing to domains such as electronic health record data. Similarly, reinforcement learning is discussed in the context of robotic-assisted surgery, and generalized deep-learning methods for genomics are reviewed."
"Molecular Mechanism for Ligand Recognition and Subtype Selectivity of Î±2C Adrenergic Receptor. Adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate different cellular signaling pathways in the presence of endogenous catecholamines and play important roles in both physiological and pathological conditions. Extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the structure and function of Î² adrenergic receptors (Î²ARs). However, the structure of Î± adrenergic receptors (Î±ARs) remains to be determined. Here, we report the structure of the human Î±2C adrenergic receptor (Î±2CAR) with the non-selective antagonist, RS79948, at 2.8 Ã…. Our structure, mutations, modeling, and functional experiments indicate that a Î±2CAR-specific D206ECL2-R409ECL3-Y4056.58 network plays a role in determining Î±2 adrenergic subtype selectivity. Furthermore, our results show that a specific loosened helix at the top of TM4 in Î±2CAR is involved in receptor activation. Together, our structure of human Î±2CAR-RS79948 provides key insight into the mechanism underlying the Î±2 adrenergic receptor activation and subtype selectivity."
"Characterization of disease-specific cellular abundance profiles of chronic inflammatory skin conditions from deconvolution of biopsy samples. Background: Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are two inflammatory skin diseases with a high prevalence and a significant burden on the patients. Underlying molecular mechanisms include chronic inflammation and abnormal proliferation. However, the cell types contributing to these molecular mechanisms are much less understood. Recently, deconvolution methodologies have allowed the digital quantification of cell types in bulk tissue based on mRNA expression data from biopsies. Using these methods to study the cellular composition of the skin enables the rapid enumeration of multiple cell types, providing insight into the numerical changes of cell types associated with chronic inflammatory skin conditions. Here, we use deconvolution to enumerate the cellular composition of the skin and estimate changes related to onset, progress, and treatment of these skin diseases. Methods: A novel signature matrix, i.e. DerM22, containing expression data from 22 reference cell types, is used, in combination with the CIBERSORT algorithm, to identify and quantify the cellular subsets within whole skin biopsy samples. We apply the approach to public microarray mRNA expression data from the skin layers and 648 samples from healthy subjects and patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The methodology is validated by comparison to experimental results from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry studies, and the deconvolution of independent data from isolated cell types. Results: We derived the relative abundance of cell types from healthy, lesional, and non-lesional skin and observed a marked increase in the abundance of keratinocytes and leukocytes in the lesions of both inflammatory dermatological conditions. The relative fraction of these cells varied from healthy to diseased skin and from non-lesional to lesional skin. We show that changes in the relative abundance of skin-related cell types can be used to distinguish between mild and severe cases of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and trace the effect of treatment. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates the value of this new resource in interpreting skin-derived transcriptomics data by enabling the direct quantification of cell types in a skin sample and the characterization of pathological changes in tissue composition."
"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) consociate in regulatory clusters in Alzheimerâ€™s disease and type 2 diabetes. Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) share the common hallmark of insulin resistance. It is conjectured that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play definitive roles in the process. To decipher the signaling overlap behind this phenotypic resemblance, the activity status of RTKs is probed in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues and cell models. Activities of only about one-third changed in a similar fashion, whereas about half of them showed opposite outcomes when exposed to contrasting signals akin to AD and T2D. Interestingly, irrespective of disease type, RTKs with enhanced and compromised activities clustered distinctly, indicating separate levels of regulations. Similar regulatory mechanisms within an activity cluster could be inferred, which have potential to impact future therapeutic developments."
"Phenotypic Screening Combined with Machine Learning for Efficient Identification of Breast Cancer-Selective Therapeutic Targets. The lack of functional understanding of most mutations in cancer, combined with the non-druggability of most proteins, challenge genomics-based identification of oncology drug targets. We implemented a machine-learning-based approach (idTRAX), which relates cell-based screening of small-molecule compounds to their kinase inhibition data, to directly identify effective and readily druggable targets. We applied idTRAX to triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and efficiently identified cancer-selective targets. For example, we found that inhibiting AKT selectively kills MFM-223 and CAL148 cells, while inhibiting FGFR2 only kills MFM-223. Since the effects of catalytically inhibiting a protein can diverge from those of reducing its levels, targets identified by idTRAX frequently differ from those identified through gene knockout/knockdown methods. This is critical if the purpose is to identify targets specifically for small-molecule drug development, whereby idTRAX may produce fewer false-positives. The rapid nature of the approach suggests that it may be applicable in personalizing therapy."
"Antibiotic Lethality Is Impacted by Nutrient Availabilities: New Insights from Machine Learning.

They use this approach to uncover how the nutritional availability for Escherichia coli impacts lethality toward three widely used antibiotics."
"Comparison of a clinical-laboratory algorithm, 4t and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia expert probability scores in the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in the critical care setting. Background: Several scoring systems are utilized to calculate the pre-test probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We hypothesize that a clinical-laboratory algorithm combining the 4Ts score with the optical density (OD) of anti-PF4-heparin antibody is more accurate than either the 4Ts or HIT expert probability (HEP) scores in the critical care setting. Methods: A single-institution retrospective review of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) that were evaluated for HIT was conducted. Two reviewers independently rated the proposed algorithm, 4Ts and HEP score. Summary, univariate and area under receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed. Results: A total of 88 patients with a mean (SD) age of 62 (15) years were included. The sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were superior in our clinical-laboratory algorithm compared to the 4Ts score â‰¥ 4 and the HEP score â‰¥ 2. The algorithmâ€™s specificity was non-inferior to the 4Ts score and HEP score. There was no significant difference between our clinical-laboratory algorithm and the 4Ts score or the HEP score in predicting HIT. Conclusion: Our study confirms that the combination of clinical and laboratory criteria is crucial in the presumable diagnosis of HIT. This is the first study that validates different HIT scores in an isolated ICU population."
"Evaluating reinforcement learning agents for anatomical landmark detection. Automatic detection of anatomical landmarks is an important step for a wide range of applications in medical image analysis. Manual annotation of landmarks is a tedious task and prone to observer errors. In this paper, we evaluate novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) strategies to train agents that can precisely and robustly localize target landmarks in medical scans. An artificial RL agent learns to identify the optimal path to the landmark by interacting with an environment, in our case 3D images. Furthermore, we investigate the use of fixed- and multi-scale search strategies with novel hierarchical action steps in a coarse-to-fine manner. Several deep Q-network (DQN) architectures are evaluated for detecting multiple landmarks using three different medical imaging datasets: fetal head ultrasound (US), adult brain and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The performance of our agents surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and RL methods. Our experiments also show that multi-scale search strategies perform significantly better than fixed-scale agents in images with large field of view and noisy background such as in cardiac MRI. Moreover, the novel hierarchical steps can significantly speed up the searching process by a factor of 4-5 times."
"Quantifying homologous proteins and proteoforms. Many proteoforms-arising from alternative splicing, post-translational modifications (PTM), or paralogous genes-have distinct biological functions, such as histone PTM proteoforms. However, their quantification by existing bottom-up mass-spectrometry (MS) methods is undermined by peptide-specific biases. To avoid these biases, we developed and implemented a first-principles model (HIquant) for quantifying proteoform stoichiometries. We characterized when MS data allow inferring proteoform stoichiometries by HIquant and derived an algorithm for optimal inference. We applied this algorithm to infer proteoform stoichiometries in two experimental systems that supported rigorous bench-marking: alkylated proteoforms spiked-in at known ratios and endogenous histone 3 PTM proteoforms quantified relative to internal heavy standards. When compared with the benchmarks, the proteoform stoichiometries interfered by HIquant without using external standards had relative error of 5-15% for simple proteoforms and 20-30% for complex proteoforms."
"Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study. BACKGROUND: For most computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) problems involving prostate cancer detection via medical imaging data, the choice of classifier has been largely ad hoc, or been motivated by classifier comparison studies that have involved large synthetic datasets. More significantly, it is currently unknown how classifier choices and trends generalize across multiple institutions, due to heterogeneous acquisition and intensity characteristics (especially when considering MR imaging data). In this work, we empirically evaluate and compare a number of different classifiers and classifier ensembles in a multi-site setting, for voxel-wise detection of prostate cancer (PCa) using radiomic texture features derived from high-resolution in vivo T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. METHODS: Twelve different supervised classifier schemes: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), naÃ¯ve Bayes, Decision Trees (DTs), and their ensemble variants (bagging, boosting), were compared in terms of classification accuracy as well as execution time. Our study utilized 85 prostate cancer T2w MRI datasets acquired from across 3 different institutions (1 for discovery, 2 for independent validation), from patients who later underwent radical prostatectomy. Surrogate ground truth for disease extent on MRI was established by expert annotation of pre-operative MRI through spatial correlation with corresponding ex vivo whole-mount histology sections. Classifier accuracy in detecting PCa extent on MRI on a per-voxel basis was evaluated via area under the ROC curve. RESULTS: The boosted DT classifier yielded the highest cross-validated AUC (= 0.744) for detecting PCa in the discovery cohort. However, in independent validation, the boosted QDA classifier was identified as the most accurate and robust for voxel-wise detection of PCa extent (AUCs of 0.735, 0.683, 0.768 across the 3 sites). The next most accurate and robust classifier was the single QDA classifier, which also enjoyed the advantage of significantly lower computation times compared to any of the other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that simpler classifiers (such as QDA and its ensemble variants) may be more robust, accurate, and efficient for prostate cancer CAD problems, especially in the context of multi-site validation."
"Taxifolin prevents postprandial hyperglycemia by regulating the activity of Î±-amylase: Evidence from an in vivo and in silico studies. There has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its associated complications globally. The postprandial stage of DM involves prompt elevation in the levels of blood glucose and Î±-amylase, a carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme is mainly involved in the regulation of postprandial hyperglycemia. This study was designed to assess the ability of a well-known flavonoid, taxifolin (TFN), against postprandial hyperglycemia and its inhibitory effects on Î±-amylase activity through the assessment of therapeutic potentials of TFN in an alloxan-induced diabetic animal model. The binding potential TFN with an Î±-amylase receptor was also investigated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and docking of to compare the binding affinities and energies of TFN and standard drug acarbose (ACB) with target enzyme. TFN significantly improved the postprandial hyperglycemia, lipid profile, and serum levels of Î±-amylase, lipase, and C-reactive protein in a dose-dependent manner when compared with that of either DM-induced and ACB-treated alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Moreover, TFN also enhanced the anti-oxidant status and normal functioning of the liver in alloxan-induced diabetic rats more efficiently as compared to that of ACB-treated alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Therapeutic potentials of TFN were also verified by MD simulation and docking results, which exhibited that the binding energy and affinity of TFN to bind with receptor was significantly higher as compared to that of ACB. Hence, the results of this study signify that TFN might be a potent inhibitor of Î±-amylase that has the potential to regulate the postprandial hyperglycemia along with its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties during the treatment of DM."
"Artificial Intelligence and Surgical Decision-Making. Importance: Surgeons make complex, high-stakes decisions under time constraints and uncertainty, with significant effect on patient outcomes. This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making. Observations: Surgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process. Conclusions and Relevance: Integration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use."
"miR-9 Upregulation Integrates Post-ischemic Neuronal Survival and Regeneration In Vitro. The irrefutable change in the expression of brain-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) following ischemic stroke has promoted the development of radical miRNA-based therapeutics encompassing neuroprotection and neuronal restoration. Our previous report on the systems-level prediction of miR-9 in post-stroke-induced neurogenesis served as a premise to experimentally uncover the functional role of miR-9 in post-ischemic neuronal survival and regeneration. The oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in SH-SY5Y cells significantly reduced miR-9 expression, while miR-9 mimic transfection enhanced post-ischemic neuronal cell viability. The next major objective involved the execution of a drug repositioning strategy to augment miR-9 expression via structure-based screening of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that bind to Histone Deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a known miR-9 target. Glucosamine emerged as the top hit and its binding potential to HDAC4 was verified by Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation, Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) assay, and MALDI-TOF MS. It was intriguing that the glucosamine treatment 1-h post-OGD was associated with the increased miR-9 level as well as enhanced neuronal viability. miR-9 mimic or post-OGD glucosamine treatment significantly increased the cellular proliferation (BrdU assay), while the neurite outgrowth assay displayed elongated neurites. The enhanced BCL2 and VEGF parallel with the reduced NFÎºB1, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and iNOS mRNA levels in miR-9 mimic or glucosamine-treated cells further substantiated their post-ischemic neuroprotective and regenerative efficacy. Hence, this study unleashes a potential therapeutic approach that integrates neuronal survival and regeneration via small-molecule-based regulation of miR-9 favoring long-term recovery against ischemic stroke."
"Evaluation of an Algorithm for Identifying Ocular Conditions in Electronic Health Record Data. Importance: For research involving big data, researchers must accurately identify patients with ocular diseases or phenotypes of interest. Reliance on administrative billing codes alone for this purpose is limiting. Objective: To develop a method to accurately identify the presence or absence of ocular conditions of interest using electronic health record (EHR) data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study is a retrospective analysis of the EHR data of patients (n = 122339) in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative Ophthalmology Data Repository who received eye care at participating academic medical centers between August 1, 2012, and August 31, 2017. An algorithm that searches structured and unstructured (free-text) EHR data for conditions of interest was developed and then tested to determine how well it could detect the presence or absence of exfoliation syndrome (XFS). The algorithm was trained to search for evidence of XFS among a sample of patients with and without XFS (n = 200) by reviewing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) billing codes, the patient's problem list, and text within the ocular examination section and unstructured (free-text) data in the EHR. The likelihood that each patient had XFS was estimated using logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The EHR data of all patients were run through the algorithm to generate an XFS probability score for each patient. The algorithm was validated with review of EHRs by glaucoma specialists. Main Outcomes and Measures: Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the algorithm were computed as the proportion of patients correctly classified with XFS or without XFS. Results: This study included 122 339 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 52.4 (25.1) years. Of these patients, 69 002 (56.4%) were female and 99 579 (81.4%) were white. The algorithm assigned a less than 10% probability of XFS for 121 085 patients (99.0%) as well as an XFS probability score of more than 75% for 543 patients (0.4%), more than 90% for 353 patients (0.3%), and more than 99% for 83 patients (0.07%). Validated by glaucoma specialists, the algorithm had a PPV of 95.0% (95% CI, 89.5%-97.7%) and an NPV of 100% (95% CI, 91.2%-100%). When there was ICD-9 or ICD-10 billing code documentation of XFS, in 86% or 96% of the records, respectively, evidence of XFS was also recorded elsewhere in the EHR. Conversely, when there was clinical examination or free-text evidence of XFS, it was documented with ICD-9 codes only approximately 40% of the time and even less often with ICD-10 codes. Conclusions and Relevance: The algorithm developed, tested, and validated in this study appears to be better at identifying the presence or absence of XFS in EHR data than the conventional approach of assessing only billing codes; such an algorithm may enhance the ability of investigators to use EHR data to study patients with ocular diseases."
"Segmentation and analysis of surface characteristics of oral tissues obtained by scanning electron microscopy to differentiate normal and oral precancerous condition. Abnormal epithelial stratification is a sign of oral dysplasia and hence evaluation of surface characteristics of oral epithelial region can help in detection of cancerous progression. Surface characteristics can be better visualised by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in comparison to light microscopy. In our study we have developed automated image processing algorithms i.e. Gaussian with median filtering and Gradient filtering, using MATLAB 2016b, to segment the surface characteristics i.e. the ridges and pits in the SEM images of oral tissue of normal (13 samples) and Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF) (36 samples) subjects. After segmentation, quantitative measurement of the parameters like area, thickness and textural features like entropy, contrast and range filter of ridges as well as area of pit and the ratio of area of ridge vs. area of pit was done. Statistical significant differences were obtained in between normal and OSF study groups for thickness (p=0.0107), entropy (p<0.00001) and contrast of ridge (p<0.00001) for Gaussian with median filtering and for all the parameters except thickness of the ridge(p=1.386), for Gradient filtering. Thus, computer aided image processing by Gradient filter followed by quantitative measurement of the surface characteristics provided precise differentiation between normal and precancerous oral condition."
"Bleeding in cardiac patients prescribed antithrombotic drugs: electronic health record phenotyping algorithms, incidence, trends and prognosis. BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines and public health authorities lack recommendations on scalable approaches to defining and monitoring the occurrence and severity of bleeding in populations prescribed antithrombotic therapy. METHODS: We examined linked primary care, hospital admission and death registry electronic health records (CALIBER 1998-2010, England) of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stable angina with the aim to develop algorithms for bleeding events. Using the developed bleeding phenotypes, Kaplan-Meier plots were used to estimate the incidence of bleeding events and we used Cox regression models to assess the prognosis for all-cause mortality, atherothrombotic events and further bleeding. RESULTS: We present electronic health record phenotyping algorithms for bleeding based on bleeding diagnosis in primary or hospital care, symptoms, transfusion, surgical procedures and haemoglobin values. In validation of the phenotype, we estimated a positive predictive value of 0.88 (95% CI 0.64, 0.99) for hospitalised bleeding. Amongst 128,815 patients, 27,259 (21.2%) had at least 1 bleeding event, with 5-year risks of bleeding of 29.1%, 21.9%, 25.3% and 23.4% following diagnoses of atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina and stable angina, respectively. Rates of hospitalised bleeding per 1000 patients more than doubled from 1.02 (95% CI 0.83, 1.22) in January 1998 to 2.68 (95% CI 2.49, 2.88) in December 2009 coinciding with the increased rates of antiplatelet and vitamin K antagonist prescribing. Patients with hospitalised bleeding and primary care bleeding, with or without markers of severity, were at increased risk of all-cause mortality and atherothrombotic events compared to those with no bleeding. For example, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.98 (95% CI 1.86, 2.11) for primary care bleeding with markers of severity and 1.99 (95% CI 1.92, 2.05) for hospitalised bleeding without markers of severity, compared to patients with no bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic health record bleeding phenotyping algorithms offer a scalable approach to monitoring bleeding in the population. Incidence of bleeding has doubled in incidence since 1998, affects one in four cardiovascular disease patients, and is associated with poor prognosis. Efforts are required to tackle this iatrogenic epidemic."
"Identification and validation of l-asparaginase as a potential metabolic target against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has emerged as a major health challenge, necessitating the search for new molecular targets. A secretory amidohydrolase, l-asparaginase of Mtb (MtA), originally implicated in nitrogen assimilation and neutralization of acidic microenvironment inside human alveolar macrophages, has been proposed as a crucial metabolic enzyme. To investigate whether this enzyme could serve as a potential drug target, it was studied for structural details and active siteâ€“specific inhibitors were tested on cultured Mycobacterial strain. The structural details of MtA obtained through comparative modeling and molecular dynamics simulations provided insights about the orchestration of an alternate reaction mechanism at the active site. This was contrary to the critical Tyr flipping mechanism reported in other asparaginases. We report the novel finding of Tyr to Val replacement in catalytic triad I along with the structural reorganization of a Î²-hairpin loop upon substrate binding in MtA active site. Further,Â 5 MtA-specific, active-siteâ€“based inhibitors were obtained by following a rigorous differential screening protocol. When tested on Mycobacterium culture, 3 of these, M3 (ZINC 4740895), M26 (ZINC 33535), and doxorubicin showed promising results with inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of 431, 100, and 56 ÂµM, respectively. Based on our findings and considering stark differences with human asparaginase, we project MtA as a promising molecular target against which the selected inhibitors may be used to counteract Mtb infection effectively."
"A deep learning model incorporating part of speech and self-matching attention for named entity recognition of Chinese electronic medical records. BACKGROUND: The Named Entity Recognition (NER) task as a key step in the extraction of health information, has encountered many challenges in Chinese Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Firstly, the casual use of Chinese abbreviations and doctors' personal style may result in multiple expressions of the same entity, and we lack a common Chinese medical dictionary to perform accurate entity extraction. Secondly, the electronic medical record contains entities from a variety of categories of entities, and the length of those entities in different categories varies greatly, which increases the difficult in the extraction for the Chinese NER. Therefore, the entity boundary detection becomes the key to perform accurate entity extraction of Chinese EMRs, and we need to develop a model that supports multiple length entity recognition without relying on any medical dictionary. METHODS: In this study, we incorporate part-of-speech (POS) information into the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of Chinese entity boundary detection. In order to avoid the wrongly POS tagging of long entities, we proposed a method called reduced POS tagging that reserves the tags of general words but not of the seemingly medical entities. The model proposed in this paper, named SM-LSTM-CRF, consists of three layers: self-matching attention layer - calculating the relevance of each character to the entire sentence; LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer - capturing the context feature of each character; CRF (Conditional Random Field) layer - labeling characters based on their features and transfer rules. RESULTS: The experimental results at a Chinese EMRs dataset show that the F1 value of SM-LSTM-CRF is increased by 2.59% compared to that of the LSTM-CRF. After adding POS feature in the model, we get an improvement of about 7.74% at F1. The reduced POS tagging reduces the false tagging on long entities, thus increases the F1 value by 2.42% and achieves an F1 score of 80.07%. CONCLUSIONS: The POS feature marked by the reduced POS tagging together with self-matching attention mechanism puts a stranglehold on entity boundaries and has a good performance in the recognition of clinical entities."
"Predicting patient-reported outcomes following hip and knee replacement surgery using supervised machine learning. BACKGROUND: Machine-learning classifiers mostly offer good predictive performance and are increasingly used to support shared decision-making in clinical practice. Focusing on performance and practicability, this study evaluates prediction of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by eight supervised classifiers including a linear model, following hip and knee replacement surgery. METHODS: NHS PRO data (130,945 observations) from April 2015 to April 2017 were used to train and test eight classifiers to predict binary postoperative improvement based on minimal important differences. Area under the receiver operating characteristic, J-statistic and several other metrics were calculated. The dependent outcomes were generic and disease-specific improvement based on the EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale (VAS) as well as the Oxford Hip and Knee Score (Q score). RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic of the best training models was around 0.87 (VAS) and 0.78 (Q score) for hip replacement, while it was around 0.86 (VAS) and 0.70 (Q score) for knee replacement surgery. Extreme gradient boosting, random forests, multistep elastic net and linear model provided the highest overall J-statistics. Based on variable importance, the most important predictors for post-operative outcomes were preoperative VAS, Q score and single Q score dimensions. Sensitivity analysis for hip replacement VAS evaluated the influence of minimal important difference, patient selection criteria as well as additional data years. Together with a small benchmark of the NHS prediction model, robustness of our results was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Supervised machine-learning implementations, like extreme gradient boosting, can provide better performance than linear models and should be considered, when high predictive performance is needed. Preoperative VAS, Q score and specific dimensions like limping are the most important predictors for postoperative hip and knee PROMs."
"Structural determinants governing Î²-arrestin2 interaction with PDZ proteins and recruitment to CRFR1. Î²-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins best know for their vital role in regulating G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking and signaling. Î²-arrestin2 recruitment and receptor internalization of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1), a GPCR whose antagonists have been shown to demonstrate both anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects, have previously been shown to be modulated by PDZ proteins. Thus, a structural characterization of the interaction between Î²-arrestins and PDZ proteins can delineate potential mechanism of PDZ-dependent regulation of GPCR trafficking. Here, we find that the PDZ proteins PSD-95, MAGI1, and PDZK1 interact with Î²-arrestin2 in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. Further investigation of such interaction using mutational analyses revealed that mutating the alanine residue at 175 residue of Î²-arrestin2 to phenylalanine impairs interaction with PSD-95. Additionally, A175F mutant of Î²-arrestin2 shows decreased CRF-stimulated recruitment to CRFR1 and reduced receptor internalization. Thus, our findings show that the interaction between Î²-arrestins and PDZ proteins is key for CRFR1 trafficking and may be targeted to mitigate impaired CRFR1 signaling in mental and psychiatric disorders."
"Assessing the effectiveness of artificial intelligence methods for melanoma: A retrospective review. BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence methods for the classification of melanoma have been studied extensively. However, few studies compare these methods under the same standards. OBJECTIVE: To seek the best artificial intelligence method for diagnosis of melanoma. METHODS: The contrast test used 2200 dermoscopic images. Image segmentations, feature extractions, and classifications were performed in sequence for evaluation of traditional machine learning algorithms. The recent popular convolutional neural network frameworks were used for transfer learning training classification. RESULTS: The region growing algorithm has the best segmentation performance, with an intersection over union of 70.06% and a false-positive rate of 17.67%. Classification performance was better with logistic regression, with a sensitivity of 76.36% and a specificity of 87.04%. The Inception V3 model (Google, Mountain View, CA) worked best in deep learning algorithms: the accuracy was 93.74%, the sensitivity was 94.36%, and the specificity was 85.64%. LIMITATIONS: There was no division in the severity of melanoma samples used in this experiment. The data set was relatively small for deep learning. CONCLUSION: The performance of traditional machine learning is satisfactory for the small data set of melanoma dermoscopic images, and the potential for deep learning in the future big data era is enormous."
"Evidence for the impact of BAG3 on electrophysiological activity of primary culture of neonatal cardiomyocytes. Homeostasis of proteins involved in contractility of individual cardiomyocytes and those coupling adjacent cells is of critical importance as any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction may result in cardiac irregular activity and heart failure. Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a stress-induced protein whose role in stabilizing myofibril proteins as well as protein quality control pathways, especially in the cardiac tissue, has captured much attention. Mutations of BAG3 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac complications such as dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we have used an in vitro model of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to investigate potential impacts of BAG3 on electrophysiological activity by employing the microelectrode array (MEA) technology. Our MEA data showed that BAG3 plays an important role in the cardiac signal generation as reduced levels of BAG3 led to lower signal frequency and amplitude. Our analysis also revealed that BAG3 is essential to the signal propagation throughout the myocardium, as the MEA data-based conduction velocity, connectivity degree, activation time, and synchrony were adversely affected by BAG3 knockdown. Moreover, BAG3 deficiency was demonstrated to be connected with the emergence of independently beating clusters of cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, BAG3 overexpression improved the activity of cardiomyocytes in terms of electrical signal amplitude and connectivity degree. Overall, by providing more in-depth analyses and characterization of electrophysiological parameters, this study reveals that BAG3 is of critical importance for electrical activity of neonatal cardiomyocytes."
"A functional agonist of insect olfactory receptors: Behavior, physiology and structure. Chemical signaling is ubiquitous and employs a variety of receptor types to detect the cacophony of molecules relevant for each living organism. Insects, our most diverse taxon, have evolved unique olfactory receptors with as little as 10% sequence identity between receptor types. We have identified a promiscuous volatile, 2-methyltetrahydro-3-furanone (coffee furanone), that elicits chemosensory and behavioral activity across multiple insect orders and receptors. In vivo and in vitro physiology showed that coffee furanone was detected by roughly 80% of the recorded neurons expressing the insect-specific olfactory receptor complex in the antenna of Drosophila melanogaster, at concentrations similar to other known, and less promiscuous, ligands. Neurons expressing specialized receptors, other chemoreceptor types, or mutants lacking the complex entirely did not respond to this compound. This indicates that coffee furanone is a promiscuous ligand for the insect olfactory receptor complex itself and did not induce non-specific cellular responses. In addition, we present homology modeling and docking studies with selected olfactory receptors that suggest conserved interaction regions for both coffee furanone and known ligands. Apart from its physiological activity, this known food additive elicits a behavioral response for several insects, including mosquitoes, flies, and cockroaches. A broad-scale behaviorally active molecule non-toxic to humans thus has significant implications for health and agriculture. Coffee furanone serves as a unique tool to unlock molecular, physiological, and behavioral relationships across this diverse receptor family and animal taxa."
"Genomic data analysis workflows for tumors from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs): Challenges and guidelines. Background: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are in vivo models of human cancer that have been used for translational cancer research and therapy selection for individual patients. The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) PDX resource comprises 455 models originating from 34 different primary sites (as of 05/08/2019). The models undergo rigorous quality control and are genomically characterized to identify somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and transcriptional profiles. Bioinformatics workflows for analyzing genomic data obtained from human tumors engrafted in a mouse host (i.e., Patient-Derived Xenografts; PDXs) must address challenges such as discriminating between mouse and human sequence reads and accurately identifying somatic mutations and copy number alterations when paired non-tumor DNA from the patient is not available for comparison. Results: We report here data analysis workflows and guidelines that address these challenges and achieve reliable identification of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and transcriptomic profiles of tumors from PDX models that lack genomic data from paired non-tumor tissue for comparison. Our workflows incorporate commonly used software and public databases but are tailored to address the specific challenges of PDX genomics data analysis through parameter tuning and customized data filters and result in improved accuracy for the detection of somatic alterations in PDX models. We also report a gene expression-based classifier that can identify EBV-transformed tumors. We validated our analytical approaches using data simulations and demonstrated the overall concordance of the genomic properties of xenograft tumors with data from primary human tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Conclusions: The analysis workflows that we have developed to accurately predict somatic profiles of tumors from PDX models that lack normal tissue for comparison enable the identification of the key oncogenic genomic and expression signatures to support model selection and/or biomarker development in therapeutic studies. A reference implementation of our analysis recommendations is available at https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/PDX-Analysis-Workflows."
"Yield and Efficiency of Novel Intensified Tuberculosis Case-Finding Algorithms for People Living with HIV. RATIONALE: The recommended tuberculosis (TB) intensified case finding (ICF) algorithm for people living with HIV (symptom-based screening followed by Xpert MTB/RIF [Xpert] testing) is insufficiently sensitive and results in unnecessary Xpert testing. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether novel ICF algorithms combining C-reactive protein (CRP)-based screening with urine Determine TB-LAM (TB-LAM), sputum Xpert, and/or sputum culture could improve ICF yield and efficiency. METHODS: We compared the yield and efficiency of novel ICF algorithms inclusive of point-of-care CRP-based TB screening and confirmatory testing with urine TB-LAM (if CD4 count </=100 cells/mul), sputum Xpert, and/or a single sputum culture among consecutive people living with HIV with CD4 counts less than or equal to 350 cells/mul initiating antiretroviral therapy in Uganda. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,245 people living with HIV, 203 (16%) had culture-confirmed TB including 101 (49%) patients with CD4 counts less than or equal to 100 cells/mul. Compared with the current ICF algorithm, point-of-care CRP-based TB screening followed by Xpert testing had similar yield (56% [95% confidence interval, 49-63] vs. 59% [95% confidence interval, 51-65]) but consumed less than half as many Xpert assays per TB case detected (9 vs. 4). Addition of TB-LAM did not significantly increase diagnostic yield relative to the current ICF algorithm but provided same-day diagnosis for 26% of TB patients with advanced HIV. Addition of a single culture to TB-LAM and Xpert substantially improved ICF yield, identifying 78% of all TB cases. CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care CRP-based screening can improve ICF efficiency among people living with HIV. Addition of TB-LAM and a single culture to Xpert confirmatory testing could enable HIV programs to increase the speed of TB diagnosis and ICF yield."
"Monitoring Disease Progression With a Quantitative Severity Scale for Retinopathy of Prematurity Using Deep Learning. Importance: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide, but clinical diagnosis is subjective and qualitative. Objective: To describe a quantitative ROP severity score derived using a deep learning algorithm designed to evaluate plus disease and to assess its utility for objectively monitoring ROP progression. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included images from 5255 clinical examinations of 871 premature infants who met the ROP screening criteria of the Imaging and Informatics in ROP (i-ROP) Consortium, which comprises 9 tertiary care centers in North America, from July 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from July 2017 to May 2018. Exposure: A deep learning algorithm was used to assign a continuous ROP vascular severity score from 1 (most normal) to 9 (most severe) at each examination based on a single posterior photograph compared with a reference standard diagnosis (RSD) simplified into 4 categories: no ROP, mild ROP, type 2 ROP or pre-plus disease, or type 1 ROP. Disease course was assessed longitudinally across multiple examinations for all patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean ROP vascular severity score progression over time compared with the RSD. Results: A total of 5255 clinical examinations from 871 infants (mean [SD] gestational age, 27.0 [2.0] weeks; 493 [56.6%] male; mean [SD] birth weight, 949 [271] g) were analyzed. The median severity scores for each category were as follows: 1.1 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.0-1.5) (no ROP), 1.5 (IQR, 1.1-3.4) (mild ROP), 4.6 (IQR, 2.4-5.3) (type 2 and pre-plus), and 7.5 (IQR, 5.0-8.7) (treatment-requiring ROP) (P < .001). When the long-term differences in the median severity scores across time between the eyes progressing to treatment and those who did not eventually require treatment were compared, the median score was higher in the treatment group by 0.06 at 30 to 32 weeks, 0.75 at 32 to 34 weeks, 3.56 at 34 to 36 weeks, 3.71 at 36 to 38 weeks, and 3.24 at 38 to 40 weeks postmenstrual age (P < .001 for all comparisons). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that the proposed ROP vascular severity score is associated with category of disease at a given point in time and clinical progression of ROP in premature infants. Automated image analysis may be used to quantify clinical disease progression and identify infants at high risk for eventually developing treatment-requiring ROP. This finding has implications for quality and delivery of ROP care and for future approaches to disease classification."
"Proof-of-concept study: Homomorphically encrypted data can support real-time learning in personalized cancer medicine. BACKGROUND: The successful introduction of homomorphic encryption (HE) in clinical research holds promise for improving acceptance of data-sharing protocols, increasing sample sizes, and accelerating learning from real-world data (RWD). A well-scoped use case for HE would pave the way for more widespread adoption in healthcare applications. Determining the efficacy of targeted cancer treatments used off-label for a variety of genetically defined conditions is an excellent candidate for introduction of HE-based learning systems because of a significant unmet need to share and combine confidential data, the use of relatively simple algorithms, and an opportunity to reach large numbers of willing study participants. METHODS: We used published literature to estimate the numbers of patients who might be eligible to receive treatments approved for other indications based on molecular profiles. We then estimated the sample size and number of variables that would be required for a successful system to detect exceptional responses with sufficient power. We generated an appropriately sized, simulated dataset (nÂ =â€‰5000) and used an established HE algorithm to detect exceptional responses and calculate total drug exposure, while the data remained encrypted. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using an HE-based system to identify exceptional responders and perform calculations on patient data during a hypothetical 3-year study. Although homomorphically encrypted computations are time consuming, the required basic computations (i.e., addition) do not pose a critical bottleneck to the analysis. CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-concept study, based on simulated data, we demonstrate that identifying exceptional responders to targeted cancer treatments represents a valuable and feasible use case. Past solutions to either completely anonymize data or restrict access through stringent data use agreements have limited the utility of abundant and valuable data. Because of its privacy protections, we believe that an HE-based learning system for real-world cancer treatment would entice thousands more patients to voluntarily contribute data through participation in research studies beyond the currently available secondary data populated from hospital electronic health records and administrative claims. Forming collaborations between technical experts, physicians, patient advocates, payers, and researchers, and testing the system on existing RWD are critical next steps to making HE-based learning a reality in healthcare."
"Application of a Neural Network Whole Transcriptome-Based Pan-Cancer Method for Diagnosis of Primary and Metastatic Cancers. Importance: A molecular diagnostic method that incorporates information about the transcriptional status of all genes across multiple tissue types can strengthen confidence in cancer diagnosis. Objective: To determine the practical use of a whole transcriptome-based pan-cancer method in diagnosing primary and metastatic cancers and resolving complex diagnoses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional diagnostic study assessed Supervised Cancer Origin Prediction Using Expression (SCOPE), a machine learning method using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing data. Training was performed on publicly available primary cancer data sets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas. Testing was performed retrospectively on untreated primary cancers and treated metastases from volunteer adult patients at BC Cancer in Vancouver, British Columbia, from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2016, and testing spanned 10â€¯822 samples and 66 output classes representing untreated primary cancers (nâ€‰=â€‰40) and adjacent normal tissues (nâ€‰=â€‰26). SCOPE's performance was demonstrated on 211 untreated primary mesothelioma cancers and 201 treatment-resistant metastatic cancers. Finally, SCOPE was used to identify the putative site of origin in 15 cases with initial presentation as cancers with unknown primary of origin. Results: A total of 10â€¯688 adult patient samples representing 40 untreated primary tumor types and 26 adjacent-normal tissues were used for training. Demographic data were not available for all data sets. Among the training data set, 5157 of 10 244 (50.3%) were male and the mean (SD) age was 58.9 (14.5) years. Testing was performed on 211 patients with untreated primary mesothelioma (173 [82.0%] male; mean [SD] age, 64.5 [11.3] years); 201 patients with treatment-resistant cancers (141 [70.1%] female; mean [SD] age, 55.6 [12.9] years); and 15 patients with cancers of unknown primary of origin; among the treatment-resistant cancers, 168 were metastatic, and 33 were the primary presentation. An accuracy rate of 99% was obtained for primary epithelioid mesotheliomas tested (125 of 126). The remaining 85 mesotheliomas had a mixed etiology (sarcomatoid mesotheliomas) and were correctly identified as a mixture of their primary components, with potential implications in resolving subtypes and incidences of mixed histology. SCOPE achieved an overall mean (SD) accuracy rate of 86% (11%) and F1 score of 0.79 (0.12) on the 201 treatment-resistant cancers and matched 12 of 15 of the putative diagnoses for cancers with indeterminate diagnosis from conventional pathology. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that machine learning approaches incorporating multiple tumor profiles can more accurately identify the cancerous state and discriminate it from normal cells. SCOPE uses the whole transcriptomes from normal and tumor tissues, and results of this study suggest that it performs well for rare cancer types, primary cancers, treatment-resistant metastatic cancers, and cancers of unknown primary of origin. Genes most relevant in SCOPE's decision making were examined, and several are known biological markers of respective cancers. SCOPE may be applied as an orthogonal diagnostic method in cases where the site of origin of a cancer is unknown, or when standard pathology assessment is inconclusive."
"Learning the implicit strain reconstruction in ultrasound elastography using privileged information. Quasi-static ultrasound elastography is an importance imaging technology to assess the conditions of various diseases through reconstructing the tissue strain from radio frequency data. State-of-the-art strain reconstruction techniques suffer from the inexperienced user unfriendliness, high model bias, and low effectiveness-to-efficiency ratio. The three challenges result from the explicitness characteristic (i.e. explicit formulation of the reconstruction model) in these techniques. For these challenges, we are the first to develop an implicit strain reconstruction framework by a deep neural network architecture. However, the classic neural network methods are unsuitable to the strain reconstruction task because they are difficult to impose any direct influence on the intermediate state of the learning process. This may lead the map learned by the neural network to be biased with the desired map. In order to correct the intermediate state of the learning process, our framework proposes the learning-using-privileged-information (LUPI) paradigm with causality in the network. It provides the causal privileged information besides the training examples to help the network learning, while makes these privileged information unavailable at the test stage. This improvement can narrow the search region of the map learned by the network, and thus prompts the network to evolve towards the actual ultrasound elastography process. Moreover, in order to ensure the causality in LUPI, our framework proposes a physically-based data generation strategy to produce the triplets of privileged information, training examples and labels. This data generation process can approximately describes the actual ultrasound elastography process by the numerical simulation based on the tissue biomechanics and ultrasound physics. It thus can build the causal relationship between the privileged information and training examples/labels. It can also address the medical data insufficiency problem. The performance of our framework has been validated on 100 simulation data, 42 phantom data and 4 real clinical data by comparing with the ground truth performed by an ultrasound simulation system and four state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that our framework is well agreed (average bias is 0.065 for strain reconstruction) with the ground truth, as well as superior to these state-of-the-art methods. These results can demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in the strain reconstruction."
"The effect of motion correction interpolation on quantitative T1 mapping with MRI. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is a technique for mapping the physical properties of the underlying tissue using several MR images with different contrasts. To overcome subject motion between the acquired images, it is necessary to register the images to a common reference frame. A drawback of registration is the use of interpolation and resampling techniques, which can introduce artifacts into the interpolated data. These artifacts could have unfavorable effects on the accuracy of the estimated tissue's physical properties. Here, we quantified the error of interpolation and resampling on T1-weighted images and studied its effects on the mapping of the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) using variable flip angles. We simulated T1-weighted images and calculated the transformation error resulting from interpolation and resampling. We found that the error is a function of the image contrast (i.e., flip angle) and of the translation and rotation of the image. Furthermore, we found that the error in the T1-weighted images has a substantial effect on the T1 estimation, of the order of 10% of the signal in the brain's gray and white matter. Hence, minimizing the registration error can enable more accurate in vivo modeling of brain microstructure."
"Patient-reported outcomes following enzalutamide or placebo in men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (PROSPER): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Background: In the PROSPER trial, enzalutamide significantly improved metastasis-free survival in patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we report the results of patient-reported outcomes of this study. Methods: In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PROSPER trial, done at 254 study sites worldwide, patients aged 18 years or older with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of up to 10 months were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice web recognition system to receive oral enzalutamide (160 mg per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by prostate-specific antigen doubling time and baseline use of a bone-targeting agent. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival, reported elsewhere. Secondary efficacy endpoints, reported here, were pain progression (assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form [BPI-SF] questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-PR25], the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 5-Levels health questionnaire visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-FL, EQ-VAS], and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P] questionnaires). Patients completed questionnaires at baseline, week 17, and every 16 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. We used predefined questionnaire thresholds to identify clinically meaningful changes. Enrolment for PROSPER is complete and follow-up continues. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02003924. Findings: Between Nov 26, 2013, and June 28, 2017, 1401 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive enzalutamide (n=933) or placebo (n=468). Median follow-up was 18Â·5 months (IQR 10Â·7â€“29Â·2) in the enzalutamide group and 15Â·1 months (7Â·4â€“25Â·9) in the placebo group. Patient-reported outcome scores at baseline were similar between groups. Changes in least squares mean from baseline to week 97 favoured enzalutamide versus placebo for FACT-P social and family wellbeing (0Â·30 [95% CI âˆ’0Â·25 to 0Â·85] vs âˆ’0Â·64 [âˆ’1Â·51 to 0Â·24]; difference 0Â·94 [95% CI 0Â·02 to 1Â·85]; p=0Â·045) and disfavoured enzalutamide versus placebo for EORTC QLQ-PR25 hormonal treatment-related symptoms (1Â·55 [0Â·26 to 2Â·83) vs âˆ’1Â·83 [âˆ’3Â·86 to 0Â·20]; difference 3Â·38 [1Â·24 to 5Â·51]; p=0Â·0020); neither of these changes were clinically meaningful. No significant differences were observed between treatments for changes from baseline to week 97 in any other patient-reported outcome score. Time to clinically meaningful pain progression as assessed by BPI-SF pain severity was longer with enzalutamide than with placebo (median 36Â·83 months, [95% CI 34Â·69 to not reached [NR] vs NR; hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·75 [95% CI 0Â·57 to 0Â·97]; p=0Â·028); there was no significant difference for BPI-SF item 3 or pain interference. Time to clinically meaningful symptom worsening was longer with enzalutamide than with placebo for EORTC QLQ-PR25 urinary symptoms (median 36Â·86 months [95% CI 33Â·35 to NR] vs 25Â·86 [18Â·53 to 29Â·47]; HR 0Â·58 [95% CI 0Â·46 to 0Â·72]; p<0Â·0001) and bowel symptoms (33Â·15 [29Â·50 to NR] vs 25Â·89 [18Â·43 to 29Â·67]; 0Â·72 [0Â·59 to 0Â·89]; p=0Â·0018), and clinically meaningful health-related quality of life as assessed by FACT-P total score (22Â·11 [18Â·63 to 25Â·86] vs 18Â·43 [14Â·85â€“19Â·35]; 0Â·83 [0Â·69 to 0Â·99]; p=0Â·037), emotional wellbeing (36Â·73 [33Â·12 to 38Â·21] vs 29Â·47 [22Â·18 to 33Â·15]; 0Â·69 [0Â·55 to 0Â·86]; p=0Â·0008), and prostate cancer subscale (18Â·43 [14Â·85 to 18Â·66] vs 14Â·69 [11Â·07 to 16Â·20]; 0Â·79 [0Â·67 to 0Â·93]; p=0Â·0042), although there was no significant difference for other FACT-P scores. Time to clinically meaningful deterioration in EORTC QLQ-PR25 hormonal treatment-related symptoms was shorter with enzalutamide than with placebo (median 33Â·15 months [95% CI 29Â·60 to NR] vs 36Â·83 [29Â·47 to NR]; HR 1Â·29 [95% CI 1Â·02 to 1Â·63]; p=0Â· 35). Time to deterioration of EQ-VAS was significantly longer for enzalutamide than for placebo (median 22Â·11 months [95% CI 18Â·46 to 25Â·66] vs 14Â·75 [11Â·07 to 18Â·17]; HR 0Â·75 [95% CI 0Â·63 to 0Â·90]; p=0Â·0013). Interpretation: Patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving enzalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival than did those who received placebo, while maintaining low pain levels and prostate cancer symptom burden and high health-related quality of life. Enzalutamide showed a clinical benefit by delaying pain progression, symptom worsening, and decrease in functional status, compared with placebo. These findings suggest that enzalutamide is a treatment option that should be discussed with patients presenting with high-risk, non- metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

"In silico identification and in vitro validation of nogalamycin N-oxide (NSC116555) as a potent anticancer compound against nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer cells. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was found to be overexpressed in several cancers, especially in lung cancers. Finding new effective drug against EGFR is the key to cancer treatment. In this study, the GOLD docking algorithm was used to virtually screen for novel human EGFR inhibitors from the NCI database. Thirty-four hit compounds were tested for EGFR-tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition. Two potent compounds, 1-amino-4-(4-[4-amino-2-sulfophenyl]anilino)-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-sulfonic acid (NSC125910), and nogalamycin N-oxide (NSC116555) were identified with IC50 values against EGFR-TK comparable to gefitinib; 16.14 and 37.71 nM, respectively. However, only NSC116555 demonstrated cytotoxic effects against nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer, A549, shown in the cell cytotoxicity assay with an IC50 of 0.19 + 0.01 ÂµM, which was more potent than gefitinib. Furthermore, NSC116555 showed cytotoxicity against A549 via apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner."
"Development and Validation of a Deep-Learning Model to Screen for Hyperkalemia from the Electrocardiogram. Importance: For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperkalemia is common, associated with fatal arrhythmias, and often asymptomatic, while guideline-directed monitoring of serum potassium is underused. A deep-learning model that enables noninvasive hyperkalemia screening from the electrocardiogram (ECG) may improve detection of this life-threatening condition. Objective: To evaluate the performance of a deep-learning model in detection of hyperkalemia from the ECG in patients with CKD. Design, Setting, and Participants: A deep convolutional neural network (DNN) was trained using 1576581 ECGs from 449380 patients seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from 1994 to 2017. The DNN was trained using 2 (leads I and II) or 4 (leads I, II, V3, and V5) ECG leads to detect serum potassium levels of 5.5 mEq/L or less (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1) and was validated using retrospective data from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona. The validation included 61965 patients with stage 3 or greater CKD. Each patient had a serum potassium count drawn within 4 hours after their ECG was recorded. Data were analyzed between April 12, 2018, and June 25, 2018. Exposures: Use of a deep-learning model. Main Outcomes and Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity, with serum potassium level as the reference standard. The model was evaluated at 2 operating points, 1 for equal specificity and sensitivity and another for high (90%) sensitivity. Results: Of the total 1638546 ECGs, 908000 (55%) were from men. The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the 3 validation data sets ranged from 2.6% (n = 1282 of 50099; Minnesota) to 4.8% (n = 287 of 6011; Florida). Using ECG leads I and II, the AUC of the deep-learning model was 0.883 (95% CI, 0.873-0.893) for Minnesota, 0.860 (95% CI, 0.837-0.883) for Florida, and 0.853 (95% CI, 0.830-0.877) for Arizona. Using a 90% sensitivity operating point, the sensitivity was 90.2% (95% CI, 88.4%-91.7%) and specificity was 63.2% (95% CI, 62.7%-63.6%) for Minnesota; the sensitivity was 91.3% (95% CI, 87.4%-94.3%) and specificity was 54.7% (95% CI, 53.4%-56.0%) for Florida; and the sensitivity was 88.9% (95% CI, 84.5%-92.4%) and specificity was 55.0% (95% CI, 53.7%-56.3%) for Arizona. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, using only 2 ECG leads, a deep-learning model detected hyperkalemia in patients with renal disease with an AUC of 0.853 to 0.883. The application of artificial intelligence to the ECG may enable screening for hyperkalemia. Prospective studies are warranted.."
"A Novel N Staging System for Predicting Survival in Patients with Medullary Thyroid Cancer. Introduction: Despite the crucially prognostic value of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), only the LNM compartment alone was reflected in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system. Objective: This study aimed to incorporate the metastatic lymph node number and metastatic lymph node ratio to generate a more accurate and appropriate N staging system for patients with MTC based on recursive partitioning analysis. Design, Setting, and Patients: Two cohorts were included in the analysis, including 1374 MTC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database as the derivation cohort, and 164 patients from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center as the validation cohort. The predictive performance of the alternative proposed N staging system was compared with that of the 8th AJCC system by using the Harrell concordance index (C-index) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: In the derivation cohort, the C-index and the AUC at 10Â years were 0.778 and 0.789, respectively, for the novel N staging system, and 0.749 and 0.741, respectively, for the 8th AJCC N staging system. Similar trends were also observed in the validation cohort. The proposed N staging system had a better prognostic performance. Conclusion: With some improvements, the novel N staging system for MTC suggested from this research may be assessed for potential adoption in the next edition of the AJCC N staging system."
"IDH1-R132H acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma via epigenetic up-regulation of the DNA damage response. Patients with glioma whose tumors carry a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1(R132H)) are younger at diagnosis and live longer. IDH1 mutations co-occur with other molecular lesions, such as 1p/19q codeletion, inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor protein 53 (TP53) gene, and loss-of-function mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked gene (ATRX). All adult low-grade gliomas (LGGs) harboring ATRX loss also express the IDH1(R132H) mutation. The current molecular classification of LGGs is based, partly, on the distribution of these mutations. We developed a genetically engineered mouse model harboring IDH1(R132H), TP53 and ATRX inactivating mutations, and activated NRAS G12V. Previously, we established that ATRX deficiency, in the context of wild-type IDH1, induces genomic instability, impairs nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair, and increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapies. In this study, using our mouse model and primary patient-derived glioma cultures with IDH1 mutations, we investigated the function of IDH1(R132H) in the context of TP53 and ATRX loss. We discovered that IDH1(R132H) expression in the genetic context of ATRX and TP53 gene inactivation (i) increases median survival in the absence of treatment, (ii) enhances DNA damage response (DDR) via epigenetic up-regulation of the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signaling pathway, and (iii) elicits tumor radioresistance. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of ATM or checkpoint kinases 1 and 2, essential kinases in the DDR, restored the tumors' radiosensitivity. Translation of these findings to patients with IDH1(132H) glioma harboring TP53 and ATRX loss could improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy and, consequently, patient survival."
"Predicting life expectancy with a long short-term memory recurrent neural network using electronic medical records. BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is one of the most important factors in end-of-life decision making. Good prognostication for example helps to determine the course of treatment and helps to anticipate the procurement of health care services and facilities, or more broadly: facilitates Advance Care Planning. Advance Care Planning improves the quality of the final phase of life by stimulating doctors to explore the preferences for end-of-life care with their patients, and people close to the patients. Physicians, however, tend to overestimate life expectancy, and miss the window of opportunity to initiate Advance Care Planning. This research tests the potential of using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for predicting life expectancy from electronic medical records. METHODS: We approached the task of predicting life expectancy as a supervised machine learning task. We trained and tested a long short-term memory recurrent neural network on the medical records of deceased patients. We developed the model with a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, and evaluated its performance on a held-out set of test data. We compared the performance of a model which does not use text features (baseline model) to the performance of a model which uses features extracted from the free texts of the medical records (keyword model), and to doctors' performance on a similar task as described in scientific literature. RESULTS: Both doctors and the baseline model were correct in 20% of the cases, taking a margin of 33% around the actual life expectancy as the target. The keyword model, in comparison, attained an accuracy of 29% with its prognoses. While doctors overestimated life expectancy in 63% of the incorrect prognoses, which harms anticipation to appropriate end-of-life care, the keyword model overestimated life expectancy in only 31% of the incorrect prognoses. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostication of life expectancy is difficult for humans. Our research shows that machine learning and natural language processing techniques offer a feasible and promising approach to predicting life expectancy. The research has potential for real-life applications, such as supporting timely recognition of the right moment to start Advance Care Planning."
"Identification of dysregulated miRNAs in triple negative breast cancer: A meta-analysis approach. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with poor clinical outcomes and lack of approved targeted therapy. Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered a promising biomarker, which plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of human cancer. Due to the increase in miRNA profiling datasets of TNBC, a proper analysis is required for studying. Therefore, this study used meta-analysis to amalgamate ten miRNA profiling studies of TNBC. By the robust rank aggregation method, metasignatures of six miRNAs (4 upregulated: hsa-miR-135b-5p, hsa-miR-18a-5p, hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-522-3p; 2 downregulated: hsa-miR-190b and hsa-miR-449a) were obtained. The gene ontology analysis revealed that target genes regulated by miRNAs were associated with processes like the regulation of transcription, DNA dependent, and signal transduction. Also, it is noted from the pathway analysis that signaling and cancer pathways were associated with the progression of TNBC. A NaÃ¯ve Bayes-based classifier built with miRNA signatures discriminates TNBC and non-TNBC samples in test data set with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. From the analysis carried out by the study, it is suggested that the identified miRNAs are of great importance in improving the diagnostics and therapeutics for TNBC."
"Defining skin cancer local recurrence. Definitions of skin cancer recurrence are variable and nonstandardized, which can lead to inconsistent and potentially inappropriate management of tumors of uncertain recurrence status. Defining recurrence is important given the potential association with metastasis in both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. A review of the literature across multiple disciplines involved in the care of skin cancer patients reveals that although criteria for recurrence are provided in the majority of cases, most are vague and inconsistent. Given the presumably increased morbidity and mortality associated with recurrent tumors, accurate identification and appropriate management is paramount. In addition, value-based health care necessitates validated and relevant outcome measures that are standardized and, thus, enable tracking of comparable and corresponding outcomes. A universal definition of localized skin cancer recurrence would ultimately allow for improved surveillance and informed therapeutic strategies to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients afflicted with skin cancer, the most common cancer nationwide."
"SarcTrack. RATIONALE: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing provide unparalleled opportunities to study cardiac biology and disease. However, sarcomeres, the fundamental units of myocyte contraction, are immature and nonlinear in hiPSC-CMs, which technically challenge accurate functional interrogation of contractile parameters in beating cells. Furthermore, existing analysis methods are relatively low-throughput, indirectly assess contractility, or only assess well-aligned sarcomeres found in mature cardiac tissues. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an analysis platform that directly, rapidly, and automatically tracks sarcomeres in beating cardiomyocytes. The platform should assess sarcomere content, contraction and relaxation parameters, and beat rate. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed SarcTrack, a MatLab software that monitors fluorescently tagged sarcomeres in hiPSC-CMs. The algorithm determines sarcomere content, sarcomere length, and returns rates of sarcomere contraction and relaxation. By rapid measurement of hundreds of sarcomeres in each hiPSC-CM, SarcTrack provides large data sets for robust statistical analyses of multiple contractile parameters. We validated SarcTrack by analyzing drug-treated hiPSC-CMs, confirming the contractility effects of compounds that directly activate (CK-1827452) or inhibit (MYK-461) myosin molecules or indirectly alter contractility (verapamil and propranolol). SarcTrack analysis of hiPSC-CMs carrying a heterozygous truncation variant in the myosin-binding protein C ( MYBPC3) gene, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, recapitulated seminal disease phenotypes including cardiac hypercontractility and diminished relaxation, abnormalities that normalized with MYK-461 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SarcTrack provides a direct and efficient method to quantitatively assess sarcomere function. By improving existing contractility analysis methods and overcoming technical challenges associated with functional evaluation of hiPSC-CMs, SarcTrack enhances translational prospects for sarcomere-regulating therapeutics and accelerates interrogation of human cardiac genetic variants."
"Pan-cancer Convergence to a Small-Cell Neuroendocrine Phenotype that Shares Susceptibilities with Hematological Malignancies. Small-cell neuroendocrine cancers (SCNCs) are an aggressive cancer subtype. Transdifferentiation toward an SCN phenotype has been reported as a resistance route in response to targeted therapies. Here, we identified a convergence to an SCN state that is widespread across epithelial cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. More broadly, non-SCN metastases have higher expression of SCN-associated transcription factors than non-SCN primary tumors. Drug sensitivity and gene dependency screens demonstrate that these convergent SCNCs have shared vulnerabilities. These common vulnerabilities are found across unannotated SCN-like epithelial cases, small-round-blue cell tumors, and unexpectedly in hematological malignancies. The SCN convergent phenotype and common sensitivity profiles with hematological cancers can guide treatment options beyond tissue-specific targeted therapies. Balanis, Sheu, et al. identify a small-cell neuroendocrine (SCN) state across various epithelial cancer types that shares genome-wide expression, methylation, and copy-number alteration patterns and associates with poor prognosis. SCN cancers have common vulnerabilities that, unexpectedly, are shared with blood cancers."
"Fully automated CT quantification of Epicardial adipose tissue by deep learning: A multicenter study. Purpose: To evaluate the performance of deep learning for robust and fully automated quantification of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) from multicenter cardiac CT data. Materials and Methods: In this multicenter study, a convolutional neural network approach was trained to quantify EAT on non-contrast material-enhanced calcium-scoring CT scans from multiple cohorts, scanners, and protocols (n = 850). Deep learning performance was compared with the performance of three expert readers and with interobserver variability in a subset of 141 scans. The deep learning algorithm was incorporated into research software. Automated EAT progression was compared with expert measurements for 70 patients with baseline and follow-up scans. Results: Automated quantification was performed in a mean (6 standard deviation) time of 1.57 seconds 6 0.49, compared with 15 minutes for experts. Deep learning provided high agreement with expert manual quantification for all scans (R = 0.974; P, 001), with no significant bias (0.53 cm3; P =. 13). Manual EAT volumes measured by two experienced readers were highly correlated (R = 0.984; P, 001) but with a bias of 4.35 cm3 (P, 001). Deep learning quantifications were highly correlated with the measurements of both experts (R = 0.973 and R = 0.979; P, 001), with significant bias for reader 1 (5.11 cm3; P, 001) but not for reader 2 (0.88 cm3; P =. 26). EAT progression by deep learning correlated strongly with manual EAT progression (R = 0.905; P, 001) in 70 patients, with no significant bias (0.64 cm3; P =. 43), and was related to an increased noncalcified plaque burden quantified from coronary CT angiography (5.7% vs 1.8%; P =. 026). Conclusion: Deep learning allows rapid, robust, and fully automated quantification of EAT from calcium scoring CT. It performs as well as an expert reader and can be implemented for routine cardiovascular risk assessment."
"Strong binding active constituents of phytochemical to BMPR1A promote bone regeneration: In vitro, in silico docking, and in vivo studies. Two of the most problematic orthopedic and neurosurgeon visits are associated with spine and craniofacial fractures. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to finding a medicine to repair these fractures. Amongst the most mysterious herbs, Aloe vera stands out. In the present study, the ameliorating function of A. vera on osteogenesis was studied in vitro and in vivo. Osteoblast-like cells were exposed to A. vera, followed by analysis of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The results showed an enhanced cell biocompatibility in a dose-dependent manner due to attenuated intracellular ROS production. Furthermore, a docking study indicated that the strong affinity of A. vera constituents to type I bone morphogenic protein receptor (BMPR1A) without the involvement of the BMPR1A chain B. The induction of osteogenesis prompts extracellular calcium deposition by osteoblasts, which affirms successful in vitro bone regeneration. However, injection of A. vera in rats with critical size calvarial defects induced Runx2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), OCN, and BMP2 genes overexpression, which led to the formation of victorious bone with enhanced bone density and ALP activity. It is worthy to note that Aloin has the highest affinity to BMPR1A, whereas there are no reports regarding the impact of Aloenin, Aloesin, and Î³-sitosterol on osteogenesis. Furthermore, some of them have antitumor potency, and it might be proposed that they are considered as a bone substitute in the osteotomy site of osteosarcoma with the aim of bone recovery and suppression of osteosarcoma. The whole consequences of this investigation manifests the plausibility of using A. vera as an antioxidant and osteoconductive substitute."
"Combined treatment with emodin and a telomerase inhibitor induces significant telomere damage/dysfunction and cell death. G-quadruplex telomeric secondary structures represent natural replication fork barriers and must be resolved to permit efficient replication. Stabilization of telomeric G4 leads to telomere dysfunctions demonstrated by telomere shortening or damage, resulting in genome instability and apoptosis. Chemical compounds targeting G4 structures have been reported to induce telomere disturbance and tumor suppression. Here, virtual screening was performed in a natural compound library using PyRx to identify novel G4 ligands. Emodin was identified as one of the best candidates, showing a great G4-binding potential. Subsequently, we confirmed that emodin could stabilize G4 structures in vitro and trigger telomere dysfunctions including fragile telomeres, telomere loss, and telomeric DNA damage. However, this telomere disturbance could be rescued by subsequent elevation of telomerase activity; in contrast, when we treated the cells with the telomerase inhibitor BIBR1532 upon emodin treatment, permanent telomere disturbance and obvious growth inhibition of 4T1-cell xenograft tumors were observed in mice. Taken together, our results show for the first time that emodin-induced telomeric DNA damage can upregulate telomerase activity, which may weaken its anticancer effect. The combined use of emodin and the telomerase inhibitor synergistically induced telomere dysfunction and inhibited tumor generation."
"Quantitative pixel intensity- and color-based image analysis on minimally compressed files: implications for whole-slide imaging. Current best practice in the quantitative analysis of microscopy images dictates that image files should be saved in a lossless format such as TIFF. Use of lossy files, including those processed with the JPEG algorithm, is highly discouraged due to effects of compression on pixel characteristics. However, with the growing popularity of whole-slide imaging (WSI) and its attendant large file sizes, compressed image files are becoming more prevelent. This prompted us to perform a color-based quantitative pixel analysis of minimally compressed WSI images. Sections from three tissues stained with one of three reagents representing the colors blue (hematoxylin), red (Oil-Red-O), and brown (immunoperoxidase) were scanned with a whole slide imager in triplicate at 20x, 40x, and 63xÂ magnifications. The resulting files were in the form of a BigTIFF with a JPEG compression automatically applied during acquisition. Images were imported into analysis software, six regions of interest were applied to various morphological locations, and the areas assessed for the color of interest. Whereas the number of designated weakly or strongly positive pixels was variable across the triplicate scans for the individual regions of interest, the total number of positive pixels was consistent. These results suggest that total positivity for a specific color representing a histochemical or immunohistochemical stain can be adequately quantitated on compressed images, but degrees of positivity (e.g., weak vs. strong) may not be as reliable. However, it is important to assess individual whole-slide imagers, file compression level and algorithm, and analysis software for reproducibility."
"CONFIGURE: A pipeline for identifying context specific regulatory modules from gene expression data and its application to breast cancer. Background: Gene expression data is widely used for identifying subtypes of diseases such as cancer. Differentially expressed gene analysis and gene set enrichment analysis are widely used for identifying biological mechanisms at the gene level and gene set level, respectively. However, the results of differentially expressed gene analysis are difficult to interpret and gene set enrichment analysis does not consider the interactions among genes in a gene set. Results: We present CONFIGURE, a pipeline that identifies context specific regulatory modules from gene expression data. First, CONFIGURE takes gene expression data and context label information as inputs and constructs regulatory modules. Then, CONFIGURE makes a regulatory module enrichment score (RMES) matrix of enrichment scores of the regulatory modules on samples using the single-sample GSEA method. CONFIGURE calculates the importance scores of the regulatory modules on each context to rank the regulatory modules. We evaluated CONFIGURE on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer RNA-seq dataset to determine whether it can produce biologically meaningful regulatory modules for breast cancer subtypes. We first evaluated whether RMESs are useful for differentiating breast cancer subtypes using a multi-class classifier and one-vs-rest binary SVM classifiers. The multi-class and one-vs-rest binary classifiers were trained using the RMESs as features and outperformed baseline classifiers. Furthermore, we conducted literature surveys on the basal-like type specific regulatory modules obtained by CONFIGURE and showed that highly ranked modules were associated with the phenotypes of basal-like type breast cancers. Conclusions: We showed that enrichment scores of regulatory modules are useful for differentiating breast cancer subtypes and validated the basal-like type specific regulatory modules by literature surveys. In doing so, we found regulatory module candidates that have not been reported in previous literature. This demonstrates that CONFIGURE can be used to predict novel regulatory markers which can be validated by downstream wet lab experiments. We validated CONFIGURE on the breast cancer RNA-seq dataset in this work but CONFIGURE can be applied to any gene expression dataset containing context information."
"Pyrazinamide drug resistance in RpsA mutant (âˆ†438A) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Dynamics of essential motions and free-energy landscape analysis. Pyrazinamide is an essential first-line antitubercular drug which plays pivotal role in tuberculosis treatment. It is a prodrug that requires amide hydrolysis by mycobacterial pyrazinamidase enzyme for conversion into pyrazinoic acid (POA). POA is known to target ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA), aspartate decarboxylase (PanD), and some other mycobacterial proteins. Spontaneous chromosomal mutations in RpsA have been reported for phenotypic resistance against pyrazinamide. We have constructed and validated 3D models of the native and Î”438A mutant form of RpsA protein. RpsA protein variants were then docked to POA and long range molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. Per residue binding free-energy calculations, free-energy landscape analysis, and essential dynamics analysis were performed to outline the mechanism underlying the high-level PZA resistance conferred by the most frequently occurring deletion mutant of RpsA. Our study revealed the conformational modulation of POA binding site due to the disruptive collective modes of motions and increased conformational flexibility in the mutant than the native form. Residue wise MMPBSA decomposition and protein-drug interaction pattern revealed the difference of energetically favorable binding site in the wild-type (WT) protein in comparison with the mutant. Analysis of size and shape of minimal energy landscape area delineated higher stability of the WT complex than the mutant form. Our study provides mechanistic insights into pyrazinamide resistance in Î”438A RpsA mutant, and the results arising out of this study will pave way for design of novel and effective inhibitors targeting the resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
"Gene-based analysis of ADHD using PASCAL: A biological insight into the novel associated genes. Background: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) which may significantly impact on the affected individual's life. ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)). In addition to PASCAL analysis a gene network and an enrichment analysis for KEGG and GO terms were carried out. Moreover, GENE2FUNC tool was employed to create gene expression heatmaps and to carry out a (DEG) (Differentially Expressed Gene) analysis using GTEX v7 and BrainSpan data. Results: PASCAL results have revealed the association of new loci with ADHD and it has also highlighted other genes previously reported by MAGMA analysis. PASCAL was able to discover new associations at a gene level for ADHD: FEZF1 (p-value: 2.2 Ã— 10- 7) and FEZF1-AS1 (p-value: 4.58 Ã— 10- 7). In addition, PASCAL has been able to highlight association of other genes that share the same LD block with some previously reported ADHD susceptibility genes. Gene network analysis has revealed several interactors with the associated ADHD genes and different GO and KEGG terms have been associated. In addition, GENE2FUNC has demonstrated the existence of several up and down regulated expression clusters when the associated genes and their interactors were considered. Conclusions: PASCAL has been revealed as an efficient tool to extract additional information from previous GWAS using their summary statistics. This study has identified novel ADHD associated genes that were not previously reported when other GBA methods were employed. Moreover, a biological insight into the biological function of the ADHD associated genes across brain regions and neurodevelopmental stages is provided."
"Ear biometrics for patient identification in global health: a field study to test the effectiveness of an image stabilization device in improving identification accuracy. BACKGROUND: In many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), difficulties in patient identification are a major obstacle to the delivery of longitudinal care. In absence of unique identifiers, biometrics have emerged as an attractive solution to the identification problem. We developed an mHealth App for subject identification using pattern recognition around ear morphology (Project SEARCH (Scanning EARS for Child Health). Early field work with the SEARCH App revealed that image stabilization would be required for optimum performance. METHODS: To improve image capture, we designed and tested a device (the 'Donut'), which standardizes distance, angle, rotation and lighting. We then ran an experimental trial with 194 participants to measure the impact of the Donut on identification rates. Images of the participant's left ear were taken both with and without use of the Donut, then processed by the SEARCH algorithm, measuring the top one and top ten most likely matches. RESULTS: With the Donut, the top one identification rate and top ten identification rates were 99.5 and 99.5%, respectively, vs. 38.4 and 24.1%, respectively, without the Donut (PÂ <â€‰0.0001 for each comparison). In sensitivity analyses, crop technique during pre-processing of images had a powerful impact on identification rates, but this too was facilitated through the Donut. CONCLUSIONS: By standardizing lighting, angle and spatial location of the ear, the Donut achieved near perfect identification rates on a cohort of 194 participants, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of using the ear as a biometric identifier. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study did not include a medical intervention or assess a medical outcome, and therefore did not meet the definition of a human subjects research study as defined by FDAAA. We did not register our study under clinicaltrials.gov ."
"Comparison and validation of accelerometer wear time and non-wear time algorithms for assessing physical activity levels in children and adolescents. BACKGROUND: Accelerometers are widely used to measure sedentary time and daily physical activity (PA). However, data collection and processing criteria, such as non-wear time rules might affect the assessment of total PA and sedentary time and the associations with health variables. The study aimed to investigate whether the choice of different non-wear time definitions would affect the outcomes of PA levels in youth. METHODS: Seventy-seven healthy youngsters (44 boys), aged 10-17â€‰years, wore an accelerometer and kept a non-wear log diary during 4 consecutives days. We compared 7 published algorithms (10, 15, 20, 30, 60â€‰min of continuous zeros, Choi, and Troiano algorithms). Agreements of each algorithm with the log diary method were assessed using Bland-Altmans plots and by calculating the concordance correlation coefficient for repeated measures. RESULTS: Variations in time spent in sedentary and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) were 30 and 3.7%. Compared with the log diary method, greater discrepancies were found for the algorithmÂ 10â€‰min (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). For the time assessed in sedentary, the agreement with diary was excellent for the 4 algorithms (Choi, râ€‰=â€‰0.79; Troiano, râ€‰=â€‰0.81; 30â€‰min, râ€‰=â€‰0.79; 60â€‰min, râ€‰=â€‰0.81). Concordance for each method was excellent for the assessment of time spent in MVPA (>â€‰0.86). The agreement for the wear time assessment was excellent for 5 algorithms (Choi râ€‰=â€‰0.79; Troiano râ€‰=â€‰0.79; 20â€‰min râ€‰=â€‰0.77; 30â€‰min râ€‰=â€‰0.80; 60â€‰min râ€‰=â€‰0.80). CONCLUSIONS: The choice of non-wear time rules may considerably affect the sedentary time assessment in youth. Using of appropriate data reduction decision in youth is needed to limit differences in associations between health outcomes and sedentary behaviors and may improve comparability for future studies. Based on our results, we recommend the use of the algorithm of 30â€‰min of continuous zeros for defining non-wear time to improve the accuracy in assessing PA levels in youth. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02844101 (retrospectively registered at July 13th 2016)."
"Investigation of structural stability and functionality of homodimeric gramicidin towards peptide-based drug: a molecular simulation approach. Increasing death rates due to antibiotic resistance deteriorate the existing treatment measures. Antimicrobial peptides have turned into the emerging cure for multidrug resistance. However, the stability and functionality determine an antimicrobial peptide as a drug. Analyses of the homodimeric Î²-helical peptide, gramicidin have suggested the significant role of gramicidin-A, gramicidin-B, and gramicidin-C as antimicrobial compounds, but the structural basis for understanding the stability and functionality is insufficient to resolve multidrug resistance. To identify the best template among gramicidin types as a therapeutic product, we combined a detailed comparative static analysis and dynamic analysis along with conformational free energy and secondary structure prediction. We observed that the high intramolecular interactions and the geometrical features favored gramicidin-A among other types of gramicidin. Our analyses further revealed that the secondary structure of gramicidin-A showed Î² sheets with coils along the conformations without any disruption, thereby enhanced its membrane interactions in terms of binding free energy. In conclusion, gramicidin-A has definitely showed enhanced structural stability and functionality; this could be considered the best template for a potential therapeutic product."
"A novel machine learning-derived radiotranscriptomic signature of perivascular fat improves cardiac risk prediction using coronary CT angiography. BACKGROUND: Coronary inflammation induces dynamic changes in the balance between water and lipid content in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), as captured by perivascular Fat Attenuation Index (FAI) in standard coronary CT angiography (CCTA). However, inflammation is not the only process involved in atherogenesis and we hypothesized that additional radiomic signatures of adverse fibrotic and microvascular PVAT remodelling, may further improve cardiac risk prediction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a new artificial intelligence-powered method to predict cardiac risk by analysing the radiomic profile of coronary PVAT, developed and validated in patient cohorts acquired in three different studies. In Study 1, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 167 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and the expression of genes representing inflammation, fibrosis and vascularity was linked with the radiomic features extracted from tissue CT images. Adipose tissue wavelet-transformed mean attenuation (captured by FAI) was the most sensitive radiomic feature in describing tissue inflammation (TNFA expression), while features of radiomic texture were related to adipose tissue fibrosis (COL1A1 expression) and vascularity (CD31 expression). In Study 2, we analysed 1391 coronary PVAT radiomic features in 101 patients who experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 5 years of having a CCTA and 101 matched controls, training and validating a machine learning (random forest) algorithm (fat radiomic profile, FRP) to discriminate cases from controls (C-statistic 0.77 [95%CI: 0.62-0.93] in the external validation set). The coronary FRP signature was then tested in 1575 consecutive eligible participants in the SCOT-HEART trial, where it significantly improved MACE prediction beyond traditional risk stratification that included risk factors, coronary calcium score, coronary stenosis, and high-risk plaque features on CCTA (Delta[C-statistic] = 0.126, P < 0.001). In Study 3, FRP was significantly higher in 44 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction compared with 44 matched controls, but unlike FAI, remained unchanged 6 months after the index event, confirming that FRP detects persistent PVAT changes not captured by FAI. CONCLUSION: The CCTA-based radiomic profiling of coronary artery PVAT detects perivascular structural remodelling associated with coronary artery disease, beyond inflammation. A new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered imaging biomarker (FRP) leads to a striking improvement of cardiac risk prediction over and above the current state-of-the-art."
"A step beyond the hygiene hypothesis-immune-mediated classes determined in a population-based study. BACKGROUND: Comorbidity patterns of childhood infections, atopic diseases, and adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are related to immune system programming conditions. The aim of this study was to make a step beyond the hygiene hypothesis and to comprehensively classify these patterns with latent class analysis (LCA). A second aim was to characterize the classes by associations with immunological, clinical, and sociodemographic variables. METHODS: LCA was applied to data from the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study (N = 4874, age range 35-82 years) separately for men and women. It was based on survey information on chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex, pertussis, scarlet fever, hay fever, asthma, eczema, urticaria, drug allergy, interparental violence, parental maltreatment, and trauma in early childhood. Subsequently, we examined how immune-mediated classes were reflected in leukocyte counts, inflammatory markers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, hsCRP), chronic inflammatory diseases, and mental disorders, and how they differed across social classes and birth cohorts. RESULTS: LCA results with five classes were selected for further analysis. Latent classes were similar in both sexes and were labeled according to their associations as neutral, resilient, atopic, mixed (comprising infectious and atopic diseases), and ACE class. They came across with specific differences in biomarker levels. Mental disorders typically displayed increased lifetime prevalence rates in the atopic, the mixed, and the ACE classes, and decreased rates in the resilient class. The same patterns were apparent in chronic inflammatory diseases, except that the ACE class was relevant specifically in women but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically determine immune-mediated classes that evolve early in life. They display characteristic associations with biomarker levels and somatic and psychiatric diseases occurring later in life. Moreover, they show different distributions across social classes and allow to better understand the mechanisms beyond the changes in the prevalence of chronic somatic and psychiatric diseases."
"Integrated phosphoproteomics and transcriptional classifiers reveal hidden RAS signaling dynamics in multiple myeloma. A major driver of multiple myeloma (MM) is thought to be aberrant signaling, yet no kinase inhibitors have proven successful in the clinic. Here, we employed an integrated, systems approach combining phosphoproteomic and transcriptome analysis to dissect cellular signaling in MM to inform precision medicine strategies. Unbiased phosphoproteomics initially revealed differential activation of kinases across MM cell lines and that sensitivity to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition may be particularly dependent on mTOR kinase baseline activity. We further noted differential activity of immediate downstream effectors of Ras as a function of cell line genotype. We extended these observations to patient transcriptome data in the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study. A machine-learningâ€“based classifier identified surprisingly divergent transcriptional outputs between NRAS- and KRAS-mutated tumors. Genetic dependency and gene expression analysis revealed mutated Ras as a selective vulnerability, but not other MAPK pathway genes. Transcriptional analysis further suggested that aberrant MAPK pathway activation is only present in a fraction of RAS-mutated vs wild-type RAS patients. These high-MAPK patients, enriched for NRAS Q61 mutations, have inferior outcomes, whereas RAS mutations overall carry no survival impact. We further developed an interactive software tool to relate pharmacologic and genetic kinase dependencies in myeloma. Collectively, these predictive models identify vulnerable signaling signatures and highlight surprising differences in functional signaling patterns between NRAS and KRAS mutants invisible to the genomic landscape. These results will lead to improved stratification of MM patients in precision medicine trials while also revealing unexplored modes of Ras biology in MM."
"Postmortem Cortex Samples Identify Distinct Molecular Subtypes of ALS: Retrotransposon Activation, Oxidative Stress, and Activated Glia. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. While several pathogenic mutations have been identified, the vast majority of ALS cases have no family history of disease. Thus, for most ALS cases, the disease may be a product of multiple pathways contributing to varying degrees in each patient. Using machine learning algorithms, we stratify the transcriptomes of 148 ALS postmortem cortex samples into three distinct molecular subtypes. The largest cluster, identified in 61% of patient samples, displays hallmarks of oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Another 19% of the samples shows predominant signatures of glial activation. Finally, a third group (20%) exhibits high levels of retrotransposon expression and signatures of TARDBP/TDP-43 dysfunction. We further demonstrate that TDP-43 (1) directly binds a subset of retrotransposon transcripts and contributes to their silencing in vitro, and (2) pathological TDP-43 aggregation correlates with retrotransposon de-silencing in vivo."
"Neural network-derived perfusion maps for the assessment of lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Purpose: To perform a proof-of-concept study to investigate the clinical utility of perfusion maps derived from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the workup of patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting with a large vessel occlusion. Materials and Methods: Data on endovascularly treated patients with acute ischemic stroke (n = 151; median age, 68 years [interquartile range, 59-75 years]; 82 of 151 [54.3%] women) were retrospectively extracted from a single-center institutional prospective registry (between January 2011 and December 2015). Dynamic susceptibility perfusion imaging data were processed by applying a commercially available reference method and in parallel by a recently proposed CNN method to automatically infer time to maximum of the tissue residue function (Tmax) perfusion maps. The outputs were compared by using quantitative markers of tissue at risk derived from manual segmentations of perfusion lesions from two expert raters. Results: Strong correlations of lesion volumes (Tmax. 4 seconds, 6 seconds, and. 8 seconds; R = 0.865-0.914; P 001) and good spatial overlap of respective lesion segmentations (Dice coefficients, 0.70-0.85) between the CNN method and reference output were observed. Eligibility for late-window reperfusion treatment was feasible with use of the CNN method, with complete interrater agreement for the CNN method (Cohen k = 1; P. 001), although slight discrepancies compared with the reference-based output were observed (Cohen k = 0.609-0.64; P 001). The CNN method tended to underestimate smaller lesion volumes, leading to a disagreement between the CNN and reference method in five of 45 patients (9%). Conclusion: Compared with standard deconvolution-based processing of raw perfusion data, automatic CNN-derived Tmax perfusion maps can be applied to patients who have acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke, with similar clinical utility."
"Systematic identification and analysis of dysregulated miRNA and transcription factor feed-forward loops in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiovascular disease. Although some genes and miRNAs related with HCM have been studied, the molecular regulatory mechanisms between miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) in HCM have not been systematically elucidated. In this study, we proposed a novel method for identifying dysregulated miRNA-TF feed-forward loops (FFLs) by integrating sample matched miRNA and gene expression profiles and experimentally verified interactions of TF-target gene and miRNA-target gene. We identified 316 dysregulated miRNA-TF FFLs in HCM, which were confirmed to be closely related with HCM from various perspectives. Subpathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the method was outperformed by the existing method. Furthermore, we systematically analysed the global architecture and feature of gene regulation by miRNAs and TFs in HCM, and the FFL composed of hsa-miR-17-5p, FASN and STAT3 was inferred to play critical roles in HCM. Additionally, we identified two panels of biomarkers defined by three TFs (CEBPB, HIF1A, and STAT3) and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, and hsa-miR-181a-5p) in a discovery cohort of 126 samples, which could differentiate HCM patients from healthy controls with better performance. Our work provides HCM-related dysregulated miRNA-TF FFLs for further experimental study, and provides candidate biomarkers for HCM diagnosis and treatment."
"A review of head and neck cancer staging system in the TNM classification of malignant tumors (eighth edition). A number of major modifications were made to the classification of head and neck carcinomas in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Cancer Staging Manual and Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification of Malignant Tumors. These modifications were aimed at improving the prognosis prediction accuracy of the system. In this article, we review the new edition of the TNM classification system. Among the several changes in the new system, a separate algorithm for p16-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma was included, as were new chapters on â€˜Head and Neck Skin Carcinomaâ€™ and â€˜Unknown Primary Carcinomaâ€”Cervical Nodes.â€™ Changes to Tumor (T) classification were made by introducing the depth of invasion of oral carcinoma, whereas changes to Node (N) classification were made by adding extra-nodal extension. It is believed that these changes will help improve the accuracy of the system in the prediction of prognosis. However, it is necessary to verify their validity through further clinical research."
"Microvesicle proteomic profiling of uterine liquid biopsy for ovarian cancer early detection. High-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC) is the leading cause of mortality from gynecological malignancies, because of diagnosis at a metastatic stage. Current screening options fail to improve mortality because of the absence of early-stage-specific biomarkers. We postulated that a liquid biopsy, such as utero-tubal lavage (UtL), may identify localized lesions better than systemic approaches of serum/plasma analysis. Further, while mutation-based assays are challenged by the rarity of tumor DNA within nonmutated DNA, analyzing the proteomic profile, is expected to enable earlier detection, as it reveals perturbations in both the tumor as well as in its microenvironment. To attain deep proteomic coverage and overcome the high dynamic range of this body fluid, we applied our method for microvesicle proteomics to the UtL samples. Liquid biopsies from HGOC patients (n 49) and controls (n 127) were divided into a discovery and validation sets. Data-dependent analysis of the samples on the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer provided depth of 8578 UtL proteins in total, and on average 3000 proteins per sample. We used support vector machine algorithms for sample classification, and crossed three feature-selection algorithms, to construct and validate a 9-protein classifier with 70% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity. The signature correctly identified all Stage I lesions. These results demonstrate the potential power of microvesicle-based proteomic biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis."
"Contriving multiepitope subunit vaccine by exploiting structural and nonstructural viral proteins to prevent Epsteinâ€“Barr virus-associated malignancy. Cancer is one of the common lifestyle diseases and is considered to be the leading cause of death worldwide. Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV)-infected individuals remain asymptomatic; but under certain stress conditions, EBV may lead to the development of cancers such as Burkittâ€™s and Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV-associated cancers result in a large number of deaths in Asian and African population, and no effective cure has still been developed. We, therefore, tried to devise a subunit vaccine with the help of immunoinformatic approaches that can be used for the prevention of EBV-associated malignancies. The epitopes were predicted through B-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and helper T lymphocytes (HTL) from the different oncogenic proteins of EBV. A vaccine was designed by combining the B-cell and T-cell (HTL and CTL) epitopes through linkers, and for the enhancement of immunogenicity, an adjuvant was added at the N-terminal. Further, homology modeling was performed to generate the 3D structure of the designed vaccine. Moreover, molecular docking was performed between the designed vaccine and immune receptor (TLR-3) to determine the interaction between the final vaccine construct and the immune receptor complex. In addition, molecular dynamics was performed to analyze the stable interactions between the ligand final vaccine model and receptor TLR-3 molecule. Lastly, to check the expression of our vaccine construct, we performed in silico cloning. This study needed experimental validation to ensure its effectiveness and potency to control malignancy."
"Disparities in Acceptance of Deceased Donor Kidneys between the United States and France and Estimated Effects of Increased US Acceptance. Importance: Approximately 3500 donated kidneys are discarded in the United States each year, drawing concern from Medicare and advocacy groups. Objective: To estimate the effects of more aggressive allograft acceptance practices on the donor pool and allograft survival for the population of US wait-listed kidney transplant candidates. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationwide study using validated registries from the United States and France comprising comprehensive cohorts of deceased donors with organs offered to kidney transplant centers between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. Data were analyzed between September 1, 2018, and April 5, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was kidney allograft discard. The secondary outcome was allograft failure after transplantation. We used logistic regression to model organ acceptance and discard practices in both countries. We then quantified using computer simulation models the number of kidneys discarded in the United States that a more aggressive system would have instead used for transplantation. Finally, based on actual survival data, we quantified the additional years of allograft life that a redesigned US system would have saved. Findings: In the United States, 156089 kidneys were recovered from deceased donors between 2004 and 2014, of which 128102 were transplanted, and 27987 (17.9%) were discarded. In France, among the 29984 kidneys recovered between 2004 and 2014, 27252 were transplanted, and 2732 (9.1%, P <.001 vs United States) were discarded. The mean (SD) age of kidneys transplanted in the United States was 36.51 (17.02) years vs 50.91 (17.34) years in France (P <.001). Kidney quality showed little change in the United States over time (mean [SD] kidney donor risk index [KDRI], 1.30 [0.48] in 2004 vs 1.32 [0.46] in 2014), whereas a steadily rising KDRI in France reflected a temporal trend of more aggressive organ use (mean [SD] KDRI, 1.37 [0.47] in 2004 vs 1.74 [0.72] in 2014; P <.001). We applied the French-based allocation model to the population of US deceased donor kidneys and found that 17435 (62%) of kidneys discarded in the United States would have instead been transplanted under the French system. We further determined that a redesigned system with more aggressive organ acceptance practices would generate an additional 132445 allograft life-years in the United States over the 10-year observation period. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater acceptance of kidneys from deceased donors who are older and have more comorbidities could provide major survival benefits to the population of US wait-listed patients."
"The Cancer Genome Atlas Expression Subtypes Stratify Response to Checkpoint Inhibition in Advanced Urothelial Cancer and Identify a Subset of Patients with High Survival Probability. Analysis of the IMvigor 210 trials involving patients with platinum-refractory or cisplatin-ineligible urothelial carcinoma who were treated with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab identified a resistance signature as an immune biomarker. Transcriptome profiling of 368 tumor samples from this trial revealed that the â€œgenomically unstableâ€ Lund subtype classification was associated with the best response. We developed and applied a novel single-patient subtype classifier based on The Cancer Genome Atlas 2017 expression-based molecular subtypes. We identified 11 patients with a neuronal subtype, with a 100% response rate in eight confirmed cases (2 complete response, 6 partial response), and 72% overall, including 3/11 patients with an unconfirmed response. The survival probability was extraordinarily high for the neuronal subtype, which represents a high-risk cohort with advanced disease, and may be secondary to low levels of TGFÎ² expression and high mutation/neoantigen burden. Patient summary: We describe a methodology for genomic classification of an individual patient's bladder cancer tumor and have identified a subtype that is associated with a high response rate to immunotherapy. This is an important step forward in identifying the right treatment for the right patient, which is the goal of personalized precision medicine. We describe a novel single-patient classifier based on The Cancer Genome Atlas 2017 scheme that identified the neuronal subtype of urothelial carcinoma as an extreme responder to anti-PD-L1 therapy. In the future, trials targeting subtype-based therapy may improve precision delivery of care for urothelial carcinoma."
"Novel putative drugs and key initiating genes for neurodegenerative disease determined using network-based genetic integrative analysis. Understanding the genetic causes of neurodegenerative disease (ND) can be useful for their prevention and treatment. Among the genetic variations responsible for ND, heritable germline variants have been discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and nonheritable somatic mutations have been discovered in sequencing projects. Distinguishing the important initiating genes in ND and comparing the importance of heritable and nonheritable genetic variants forÂ treating ND are important challenges. In this study, we analysed GWAS results, somatic mutations and drug targets of ND from large databanks by performing directed network-based analysis considering a randomised network hypothesis testing procedure. A disease-associated biological network was created in the context of the functional interactome, and the nonrandom topological characteristics of directed-edge classes were interpreted. Hierarchical network analysis indicated that drug targets tend to lie upstream of somatic mutations and germline variants. Furthermore, using directed path length information and biological explanations, we provide information on the most important genes in these created node classes and their associated drugs. Finally, we identified nine germline variants overlapping with drug targets for ND, seven somatic mutations close to drug targets from the hierarchical network analysis and six crucial genes in controlling other genes from the network analysis. Based on these findings, some drugs have been proposed for treating ND via drug repurposing. Our results provide new insights into the therapeutic actionability of GWAS results and somatic mutations for ND. The interesting properties of each node class and the existing relationships between them can broaden our knowledge of ND."
"Rare disease knowledge enrichment through a data-driven approach. BACKGROUND: Existing resources to assist the diagnosis of rare diseases are usually curated from the literature that can be limited for clinical use. It often takes substantial effort before the suspicion of a rare disease is even raised to utilize those resources. The primary goal of this study was to apply a data-driven approach to enrich existing rare disease resources by mining phenotype-disease associations from electronic medical record (EMR). METHODS: We first applied association rule mining algorithms on EMR to extract significant phenotype-disease associations and enriched existing rare disease resources (Human Phenotype Ontology and Orphanet (HPO-Orphanet)). We generated phenotype-disease bipartite graphs for HPO-Orphanet, EMR, and enriched knowledge base HPO-Orphanetâ€‰+â€‰and conducted a case study on Hodgkin lymphoma to compare performance on differential diagnosis among these three graphs. RESULTS: We used disease-disease similarity generated by the eRAM, an existing rare disease encyclopedia, as a gold standard to compare the three graphs with sensitivity and specificity as (0.17, 0.36, 0.46) and (0.52, 0.47, 0.51) for three graphs respectively. We also compared the top 15 diseases generated by the HPO-Orphanetâ€‰+â€‰graph with eRAM and another clinical diagnostic tool, the Phenomizer. CONCLUSIONS: Per our evaluation results, our approach was able to enrich existing rare disease knowledge resources with phenotype-disease associations from EMR and thus support rare disease differential diagnosis."
"NeoMutate: An ensemble machine learning framework for the prediction of somatic mutations in cancer. Background: The accurate screening of tumor genomic landscapes for somatic mutations using high-throughput sequencing involves a crucial step in precise clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy. However, the complex inherent features of cancer tissue, especially, tumor genetic intra-heterogeneity coupled with the problem of sequencing and alignment artifacts, makes somatic variant calling a challenging task. Current variant filtering strategies, such as rule-based filtering and consensus voting of different algorithms, have previously helped to increase specificity, although comes at the cost of sensitivity. Methods: In light of this, we have developed the NeoMutate framework which incorporates 7 supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to exploit the strengths of multiple variant callers, using a non-redundant set of biological and sequence features. We benchmarked NeoMutate by simulating more than 10,000 bona fide cancer-related mutations into three well-characterized Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference samples. Results: A robust and exhaustive evaluation of NeoMutate's performance based on 5-fold cross validation experiments, in addition to 3 independent tests, demonstrated a substantially improved variant detection accuracy compared to any of its individual composite variant callers and consensus calling of multiple tools. Conclusions: We show here that integrating multiple tools in an ensemble ML layer optimizes somatic variant detection rates, leading to a potentially improved variant selection framework for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
"Development and Performance of a Checklist for Initial Triage After an Anthrax Mass Exposure Event. Background: Population exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores could cause mass casualties requiring complex medical care. Rapid identification of patients needing anthrax-specific therapies will improve patient outcomes and resource use. Objective: To develop a checklist that rapidly distinguishes most anthrax from nonanthrax illnesses on the basis of clinical presentation and identifies patients requiring diagnostic testing after a population exposure. Design: Comparison of published anthrax case reports from 1880 through 2013 that included patients seeking anthrax-related care at 2 epicenters of the 2001 U.S. anthrax attacks. Setting: Outpatient and inpatient. Patients: 408 case patients with inhalation, ingestion, and cutaneous anthrax and primary anthrax meningitis, and 657 control patients. Measurements: Diagnostic test characteristics, including positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) and patient triage assignation. Results: Checklist-directed triage without diagnostic testing correctly classified 95% (95% CI, 93% to 97%) of 353 adult anthrax case patients and 76% (CI, 73% to 79%) of 647 control patients (positive LR, 3.96 [CI, 3.45 to 4.55]; negative LR, 0.07 [CI, 0.04 to 0.11]; false-negative rate, 5%; false-positive rate, 24%). Diagnostic testing was needed for triage in up to 5% of case patients and 15% of control patients and improved overall test characteristics (positive LR, 8.90 [CI, 7.05 to 11.24]; negative LR, 0.06 [CI, 0.04 to 0.09]; false-negative rate, 5%; false-positive rate, 11%). Checklist sensitivity and specificity were minimally affected by inclusion of pediatric patients. Sensitivity increased to 97% (CI, 94% to 100%) and 98% (CI, 96% to 100%), respectively, when only inhalation anthrax cases or higher-quality case reports were investigated. Limitations: Data on case patients were limited to nonstandardized, published observational reports, many of which lacked complete data on symptoms and signs of interest. Reporting bias favoring more severe cases and lack of intercurrent outbreaks (such as influenza) in the control populations may have improved test characteristics. Conclusion: A brief checklist covering symptoms and signs can distinguish anthrax from other conditions with minimal need for diagnostic testing after known or suspected population exposure.

"Reproducing the molecular subclassification of peripheral T-cell lymphoma-NOS by immunohistochemistry. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of mature T-cell malignancies; approximately one-third of cases are designated as PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Using gene-expression profiling (GEP), we have previously defined 2 major molecular subtypes of PTCL-NOS, PTCL-GATA3 and PTCL-TBX21, which have distinct biological differences in oncogenic pathways and prognosis. In the current study, we generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) algorithm to identify the 2 subtypes in paraffin tissue using antibodies to key transcriptional factors (GATA3 and TBX21) and their target proteins (CCR4 and CXCR3). In a training cohort of 49 cases of PTCL-NOS with corresponding GEP data, the 2 subtypes identified by the IHC algorithm matched the GEP results with high sensitivity (85%) and showed a significant difference in overall survival (OS) (P = .03). The IHC algorithm classification showed high interobserver reproducibility among pathologists and was validated in a second PTCL-NOS cohort (n = 124), where a significant difference in OS between the PTCL-GATA3 and PTCL-TBX21 subtypes was confirmed (P = .003). In multivariate analysis, a high International Prognostic Index score (3-5) and the PTCL-GATA3 subtype identified by IHC were independent adverse predictors of OS (P = .0015). Additionally, the 2 IHC-defined subtypes were significantly associated with distinct morphological features (P < .001), and there was a significant enrichment of an activated CD8+ cytotoxic phenotype in the PTCL-TBX21 subtype (P = .03). The IHC algorithm will aid in identifying the 2 subtypes in clinical practice, which will aid the future clinical management of patients and facilitate risk stratification in clinical trials."
"Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation to Manage Cardiovascular Outcomes in Cancer Patients and Survivors: A Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association. Cardiovascular disease is a competing cause of death in patients with cancer with early-stage disease. This elevated cardiovascular disease risk is thought to derive from both the direct effects of cancer therapies and the accumulation of risk factors such as hypertension, weight gain, cigarette smoking, and loss of cardiorespiratory fitness. Effective and viable strategies are needed to mitigate cardiovascular disease risk in this population; a multimodal model such as cardiac rehabilitation may be a potential solution. This statement from the American Heart Association provides an overview of the existing knowledge and rationale for the use of cardiac rehabilitation to provide structured exercise and ancillary services to cancer patients and survivors. This document introduces the concept of cardio-oncology rehabilitation, which includes identification of patients with cancer at high risk for cardiac dysfunction and a description of the cardiac rehabilitation infrastructure needed to address the unique exposures and complications related to cancer care. In this statement, we also discuss the need for future research to fully implement a multimodal model of cardiac rehabilitation for patients with cancer and to determine whether reimbursement of these services is clinically warranted."
"A deep neural network approach to predicting clinical outcomes of neuroblastoma patients. Background: The availability of high-throughput omics datasets from large patient cohorts has allowed the development of methods that aim at predicting patient clinical outcomes, such as survival and disease recurrence. Such methods are also important to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying disease etiology and development, as well as treatment responses. Recently, different predictive models, relying on distinct algorithms (including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) have been investigated. In this context, deep learning strategies are of special interest due to their demonstrated superior performance over a wide range of problems and datasets. One of the main challenges of such strategies is the ""small n large p"" problem. Indeed, omics datasets typically consist of small numbers of samples and large numbers of features relative to typical deep learning datasets. Neural networks usually tackle this problem through feature selection or by including additional constraints during the learning process. Methods: We propose to tackle this problem with a novel strategy that relies on a graph-based method for feature extraction, coupled with a deep neural network for clinical outcome prediction. The omics data are first represented as graphs whose nodes represent patients, and edges represent correlations between the patients' omics profiles. Topological features, such as centralities, are then extracted from these graphs for every node. Lastly, these features are used as input to train and test various classifiers. Results: We apply this strategy to four neuroblastoma datasets and observe that models based on neural networks are more accurate than state of the art models (DNN: 85%-87%, SVM/RF: 75%-82%). We explore how different parameters and configurations are selected in order to overcome the effects of the small data problem as well as the curse of dimensionality. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the deep neural networks capture complex features in the data that help predicting patient clinical outcomes."
"Visualizing Deep Learning Models for the Detection of Referable Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma. Importance: Convolutional neural networks have recently been applied to ophthalmic diseases; however, the rationale for the outputs generated by these systems is inscrutable to clinicians. A visualization tool is needed that would enable clinicians to understand important exposure variables in real time. Objective: To systematically visualize the convolutional neural networks of 2 validated deep learning models for the detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). Design, Setting, and Participants: The GON and referable DR algorithms were previously developed and validated (holdout method) using 48116 and 66790 retinal photographs, respectively, derived from a third-party database (LabelMe) of deidentified photographs from various clinical settings in China. In the present cross-sectional study, a random sample of 100 true-positive photographs and all false-positive cases from each of the GON and DR validation data sets were selected. All data were collected from March to June 2017. The original color fundus images were processed using an adaptive kernel visualization technique. The images were preprocessed by applying a sliding window with a size of 28 x 28 pixels and a stride of 3 pixels to crop images into smaller subimages to produce a feature map. Threshold scales were adjusted to optimal levels for each model to generate heat maps highlighting localized landmarks on the input image. A single optometrist allocated each image to predefined categories based on the generated heat map. Main Outcomes and Measures: Visualization regions of the fundus. Results: In the GON data set, 90 of 100 true-positive cases (90%; 95% CI, 82%-95%) and 15 of 22 false-positive cases (68%; 95% CI, 45%-86%) displayed heat map visualization within regions of the optic nerve head only. Lesions typically seen in cases of referable DR (exudate, hemorrhage, or vessel abnormality) were identified as the most important prognostic regions in 96 of 100 true-positive DR cases (96%; 95% CI, 90%-99%). In 39 of 46 false-positive DR cases (85%; 95% CI, 71%-94%), the heat map displayed visualization of nontraditional fundus regions with or without retinal venules. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that this visualization method can highlight traditional regions in disease diagnosis, substantiating the validity of the deep learning models investigated. This visualization technique may promote the clinical adoption of these models."
"Keratinocytic Skin Cancer Detection on the Face Using Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network. Importance: Detection of cutaneous cancer on the face using deep-learning algorithms has been challenging because various anatomic structures create curves and shades that confuse the algorithm and can potentially lead to false-positive results. Objective: To evaluate whether an algorithm can automatically locate suspected areas and predict the probability of a lesion being malignant. Design, Setting, and Participants: Region-based convolutional neural network technology was used to create 924538 possible lesions by extracting nodular benign lesions from 182348 clinical photographs. After manually or automatically annotating these possible lesions based on image findings, convolutional neural networks were trained with 1106886 image crops to locate and diagnose cancer. Validation data sets (2844 images from 673 patients; mean [SD] age, 58.2 [19.9] years; 308 men [45.8%]; 185 patients with malignant tumors, 305 with benign tumors, and 183 free of tumor) were obtained from 3 hospitals between January 1, 2010, and September 30, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F1 score (mean of precision and recall; range, 0.000-1.000), and Youden index score (sensitivity + specificity -1; 0%-100%) were used to compare the performance of the algorithm with that of the participants. Results: The algorithm analyzed a mean (SD) of 4.2 (2.4) photographs per patient and reported the malignancy score according to the highest malignancy output. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the validation data set (673 patients) was 0.910. At a high-sensitivity cutoff threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the model with the 673 patients were 76.8% and 90.6%, respectively. With the test partition (325 images; 80 patients), the performance of the algorithm was compared with the performance of 13 board-certified dermatologists, 34 dermatology residents, 20 nondermatologic physicians, and 52 members of the general public with no medical background. When the disease screening performance was evaluated at high sensitivity areas using the F1 score and Youden index score, the algorithm showed a higher F1 score (0.831 vs 0.653 [0.126], P < .001) and Youden index score (0.675 vs 0.417 [0.124], P < .001) than that of nondermatologic physicians. The accuracy of the algorithm was comparable with that of dermatologists (F1 score, 0.831 vs 0.835 [0.040]; Youden index score, 0.675 vs 0.671 [0.100]). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of the study suggest that the algorithm could localize and diagnose skin cancer without preselection of suspicious lesions by dermatologists."
"Cognitive refractory state caused by spontaneous epileptic high-frequency oscillations in the human brain. Epileptic brain tissue is often considered physiologically dysfunctional, and the optimal treatment of many patients with uncontrollable seizures involves surgical removal of the epileptic tissue. However, it is unclear to what extent the epileptic tissue is capable of generating physiological responses to cognitive stimuli and how cognitive deficits ensuing surgical resections can be determined using state-of-the-art computational methods. To address these unknowns, we recruited six patients with nonlesional epilepsies and identified the epileptic focus in each patient with intracranial electrophysiological monitoring. We measured spontaneous epileptic activity in the form of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded stimulus-locked physiological responses in the form of physiological high-frequency broadband activity, and explored the interaction of the two as well as their behavioral correlates. Across all patients, we found abundant normal physiological responses to relevant cognitive stimuli in the epileptic sites. However, these physiological responses were more likely to be ""seized"" (delayed or missed) when spontaneous HFOs occurred about 850 to 1050 ms before, until about 150 to 250 ms after, the onset of relevant cognitive stimuli. Furthermore, spontaneous HFOs in medial temporal lobe affected the subjects' memory performance. Our findings suggest that nonlesional epileptic sites are capable of generating normal physiological responses and highlight a compelling mechanism for cognitive deficits in these patients. The results also offer clinicians a quantitative tool to differentiate pathological and physiological high-frequency activities in epileptic sites and to indirectly assess their possible cognitive reserve function and approximate the risk of resective surgery."
"Multi-task exclusive relationship learning for alzheimer's disease progression prediction with longitudinal data. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. Currently, many multi-task learning approaches have been proposed to predict the disease progression at the early stage using longitudinal data, with each task corresponding to a particular time point. However, the underlying association among different time points in disease progression is still under-explored in previous studies. To this end, we propose a multi-task exclusive relationship learning model to automatically capture the intrinsic relationship among tasks at different time points for estimating clinical measures based on longitudinal imaging data. The proposed method can select the most discriminative features for different tasks and also model the intrinsic relatedness among different time points, by utilizing an exclusive lasso regularization and a relationship induced regularization. Specifically, the exclusive lasso regularization enables partial group structure feature selection among the longitudinal data, while the relationship induced regularization efficiently introduces the relationship information from data to guide knowledge transfer. We further develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the proposed objective function. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In comparison with several state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method can achieve promising performance for cognitive status prediction and also can help discover disease-related biomarkers."
"Anticancer effect of deuterium depleted water - Redox disbalance leads to oxidative stress. Despite the convincing empirical evidence that deuterium depleted water (DDW, 25-125 ppm deuterium) has anticancer effect, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, redox proteomics investigation of the DDW action in A549 cells revealed an increased level of oxidative stress, whereas expression proteomics in combination with thermal profiling uncovered crucial role of mitochondrial proteins. In the proposed scenario, reversal of the normally positive deuterium gradient across the inner membrane leads to an increased export of protons from the matrix to intermembrane space and an increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resulting oxidative stress leads to slower growth and can induce apoptosis. However, further deuterium depletion in ambient water triggers a feedback mechanism, which leads to restoration of the redox equilibrium and resumed growth. The DDW-induced oxidative stress, verified by traditional biochemical assays, may be helpful as an adjuvant to ROS-inducing anticancer therapy."
"Augmented Bladder Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning. Adequate tumor detection is critical in complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to reduce cancer recurrence, but up to 20% of bladder tumors are missed by standard white light cystoscopy. Deep learning augmented cystoscopy may improve tumor localization, intraoperative navigation, and surgical resection of bladder cancer. We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm for augmented cystoscopic detection of bladder cancer. Patients undergoing cystoscopy/TURBT were recruited and white light videos were recorded. Video frames containing histologically confirmed papillary urothelial carcinoma were selected and manually annotated. We constructed CystoNet, an image analysis platform based on convolutional neural networks, for automated bladder tumor detection using a development dataset of 95 patients for algorithm training and five patients for testing. Diagnostic performance of CystoNet was validated prospectively in an additional 54 patients. In the validation dataset, per-frame sensitivity and specificity were 90.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.3-91.6%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 98.5-98.8%), respectively. Per-tumor sensitivity was 90.9% (95% CI, 90.3-91.6%). CystoNet detected 39 of 41 papillary and three of three flat bladder cancers. With high sensitivity and specificity, CystoNet may improve the diagnostic yield of cystoscopy and efficacy of TURBT. PATIENT SUMMARY: Conventional cystoscopy has recognized shortcomings in bladder cancer detection, with implications for recurrence. Cystoscopy augmented with artificial intelligence may improve cancer detection and resection."
"Identification of a novel class of RIP1/RIP3 dual inhibitors that impede cell death and inflammation in mouse abdominal aortic aneurysm models. Receptor interacting protein kinase-1 and -3 (RIP1 and RIP3) are essential mediators of cell death processes and participate in inflammatory responses. Our group recently demonstrated that gene deletion of Rip3 or pharmacological inhibition of RIP1 attenuated pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a life-threatening degenerative vascular disease characterized by depletion of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), inflammation, negative extracellular matrix remodeling, and progressive expansion of aorta. The goal of this study was to develop drug candidates for AAA and other disease conditions involving cell death and inflammation. We screened 1141 kinase inhibitors for their ability to block necroptosis using the RIP1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s) as a selection baseline. Positive compounds were further screened for cytotoxicity and virtual binding to RIP3. A cluster of top hits, represented by GSK2593074A (GSKâ€™074), displayed structural similarity to the established RIP3 inhibitor GSKâ€™843. In multiple cell types including mouse SMCs, fibroblasts (L929), bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), and human colon epithelial cells (HT29), GSKâ€™074 inhibited necroptosis with an IC50 of ~3 nM. Furthermore, GSKâ€™074, but not Nec-1s, blocked cytokine production by SMCs. Biochemical analyses identified both RIP1 and RIP3 as the biological targets of GSKâ€™074. Unlike GSKâ€™843 which causes profound apoptosis at high doses (>3 ÂµM), GSKâ€™074 showed no detectable cytotoxicity even at 20 ÂµM. Daily intraperitoneal injection of GSKâ€™074 at 0.93 mg/kg significantly attenuated aortic expansion in two mouse models of AAA (calcium phosphate: DMSO 66.06 Â± 9.17% vs GSKâ€™074 27.36 Â± 8.25%, P < 0.05; Angiotensin II: DMSO 85.39 Â± 15.76% vs GSKâ€™074 36.28 Â± 5.76%, P < 0.05). Histologically, GSKâ€™074 treatment diminished cell death and macrophage infiltration in aneurysm-prone aortae. Together, our data suggest that GSKâ€™074 represents a new class of necroptosis inhibitors with dual targeting ability to both RIP1 and RIP3. The high potency and minimum cytotoxicity make GSKâ€™074 a desirable drug candidate of pharmacological therapies to attenuate AAA progression and other necroptosis related diseases."
"The diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for basal cell carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Dermoscopy is a noninvasive technique for the diagnosis of skin lesions. Its accuracy for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has not been systematically studied. Objective: We sought to systematically investigate the accuracy of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of BCC compared with examination with the naked eye. Methods: A systematic review of studies reporting the accuracy of naked eye examination and dermoscopy for the diagnosis of BCC was conducted. A meta-analysis for sensitivity and specificity was performed using a bivariate mixed-effects logistic regression modeling framework. Results: Seventeen studies were identified. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of BCC were 91.2% and 95%, respectively. In studies comparing test performance, adding dermoscopy to naked eye examination improved sensitivity from 66.9% to 85% (P =.0001) and specificity from 97.2% to 98.2% (P =.006). The sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy were higher for pigmented than nonpigmented BCC. Sensitivity increased when dermoscopy was performed by experts and when the diagnosis was based on in-person dermoscopy as opposed to dermoscopic photographs. Limitations: Significant heterogeneity among studies with a medium-to-high risk of bias. Conclusion: Dermoscopy is a sensitive and specific add-on tool for the diagnosis of BCC. It is especially valuable for pigmented BCC."
"Modeling DNA Unwinding by AddAB Helicaseâ€“Nuclease and Modulation by Chi Sequences: Comparison with AdnAB and RecBCD. Introduction: AddAB enzyme is a helicaseâ€“nuclease complex that initiates recombinational repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. It catalyzes processive DNA unwinding and concomitant resection of the unwound strands, which are modulated by the recognition of a recombination hotspot called Chi in the 3â€²-terminated strand. Despite extensive structural, biochemical and single molecule studies, the detailed molecular mechanism of DNA unwinding by the complex and modulation by Chi sequence remains unclear. Methods: A model of DNA unwinding by the AddAB complex and modulation by Chi recognition was presented, based on which the dynamics of AddAB complex was studied analytically. Results: The theoretical results explain well the available experimental data on effect of DNA sequence on velocity, effect of Chi recognition on velocity, static disorder peculiar to the AddAB complex, and dynamics of pausing of wild-type and mutant AddAB complexes occurring at Chi or Chi-like sequence. Predictions were provided. Comparisons of AddAB complex with other helicaseâ€“nuclease complexes such as RecBCD and AdnAB were made. Conclusions: The study has strong implications for the molecular mechanism of DNA unwinding by the AddAB complex. The intriguing issues are addressed of why Chi recognition is an inefficient process, how AddAB complex pauses upon recognizing Chi sequence, how the paused state transits to the translocating state, why the mutant AddAB with a stronger affinity to Chi sequence has a shorter pausing lifetime, why the pausing lifetime is sensitive to the solution temperature, and so on."
"Relation path feature embedding based convolutional neural network method for drug discovery. BACKGROUND: Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process. Literature-based discovery has played a critical role in drug development and may be a supplementary method to help scientists speed up the discovery of drugs. METHODS: Here, we propose a relation path features embedding based convolutional neural network model with attention mechanism for drug discovery from literature, which we denote as PACNN. First, we use predications from biomedical abstracts to construct a biomedical knowledge graph, and then apply a path ranking algorithm to extract drug-disease relation path features on the biomedical knowledge graph. After that, we use these drug-disease relation features to train a convolutional neural network model which combined with the attention mechanism. Finally, we employ the trained models to mine drugs for treating diseases. RESULTS: The experiment shows that the proposed model achieved promising results, comparing to several random walk algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we propose a relation path features embedding based convolutional neural network with attention mechanism for discovering potential drugs from literature. Our method could be an auxiliary method for drug discovery, which can speed up the discovery of new drugs for the incurable diseases."
"HiSSI: High-order SNP-SNP interactions detection based on efficient significant pattern and differential evolution. Background: Detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions is an important and challenging task in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Various efforts have been devoted to detect SNP interactions. However, the large volume of SNP datasets results in such a big number of high-order SNP combinations that restrict the power of detecting interactions. Methods: In this paper, to combat with this challenge, we propose a two-stage approach (called HiSSI) to detect high-order SNP-SNP interactions. In the screening stage, HiSSI employs a statistically significant pattern that takes into account family wise error rate, to control false positives and to effectively screen two-locus combinations candidate set. In the searching stage, HiSSI applies two different search strategies (exhaustive search and heuristic search based on differential evolution along with Ï‡ 2-test) on candidate pairwise SNP combinations to detect high-order SNP interactions. Results: Extensive experiments on simulated datasets are conducted to evaluate HiSSI and recently proposed and related approaches on both two-locus and three-locus disease models. A real genome-wide dataset: Breast cancer dataset collected from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) is also used to test HiSSI. Conclusions: Simulated experiments on both two-locus and three-locus disease models show that HiSSI is more powerful than other related approaches. Real experiment on breast cancer dataset, in which HiSSI detects some significantly two-locus and three-locus interactions associated with breast cancer, again corroborate the effectiveness of HiSSI in high-order SNP-SNP interaction identification."
"Spread of alpha-synuclein pathology through the brain connectome is modulated by selective vulnerability and predicted by network analysis. Studies of patients afflicted by neurodegenerative diseases suggest that misfolded proteins spread through the brain along anatomically connected networks, prompting progressive decline. Recently, mouse models have recapitulated the cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic proteins and neuron death observed in patients. However, the factors regulating the spread of pathogenic proteins remain a matter of debate due to an incomplete understanding of how vulnerability functions in the context of spread. Here we use quantitative pathology mapping in the mouse brain, combined with network modeling to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of spread. Patterns of alpha-synuclein pathology are well described by a network model that is based on two factors: anatomical connectivity and endogenous alpha-synuclein expression. The map and model allow the assessment of selective vulnerability to alpha-synuclein pathology development and neuron death. Finally, we use quantitative pathology to understand how the G2019S LRRK2 genetic risk factor affects the spread and toxicity of alpha-synuclein pathology."
"The intrinsic attractor manifold and population dynamics of a canonical cognitive circuit across waking and sleep. Neural circuits construct distributed representations of key variables-external stimuli or internal constructs of quantities relevant for survival, such as an estimate of one's location in the world-as vectors of population activity. Although population activity vectors may have thousands of entries (dimensions), we consider that they trace out a low-dimensional manifold whose dimension and topology match the represented variable. This manifold perspective enables blind discovery and decoding of the represented variable using only neural population activity (without knowledge of the input, output, behavior or topography). We characterize and directly visualize manifold structure in the mammalian head direction circuit, revealing that the states form a topologically nontrivial one-dimensional ring. The ring exhibits isometry and is invariant across waking and rapid eye movement sleep. This result directly demonstrates that there are continuous attractor dynamics and enables powerful inference about mechanism. Finally, external rather than internal noise limits memory fidelity, and the manifold approach reveals new dynamical trajectories during sleep."
"Deep learning for cardiovascular medicine: a practical primer. Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) showing increasing promise in medicine, to assist in data classification, novel disease phenotyping and complex decision making. Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area."
"Early inhibition of endothelial retinoid uptake upon myocardial infarction restores cardiac function and prevents cell, tissue, and animal death. Physiologically, following myocardial infarction (MI), retinoid levels elevate locally in the infarcted area. Whereas therapeutic systemic application of retinoids was shown to reduce the progression of ventricular dilatation and the onset of heart failure, the role of acute physiologically increased retinoids in the infarction zone is unknown to date. To reveal the role of local retinoids in the MI zone is the central aim of this study. Using human cell culture and co-culture models for hypoxia as well as various assays systems, lentivirus-based transgene expression, in silico molecular docking studies, and an MI model in rats, we analysed the impact of the retinoid all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on cell signalling, cell viability, tissue survival, heart function, and MI-induced death in rats. Based on our results, ATRA-mediated signalling does aggravate the MI phenotype (e.g. 2.5-fold increased mortality compared to control), whereas 5â€²-methoxyleoligin (5ML), a new agent which interferes with ATRA-signalling rescues the ATRA-dependent phenotype. On the molecular level, ATRA signalling causes induction of TXNIP, a potent inhibitor of the physiological antioxidant thioredoxin (TRX1) and sensitizes cells to necrotic cell death upon hypoxia. 5ML-mediated prevention of ATRA effects were shown to be based on the inhibition of cellular ATRA uptake by interference with the cholesterol (and retinol) binding motif of the transmembrane protein STRA6. 5ML-mediated inhibition of ATRA uptake led to a strong reduction of ATRA-dependent gene expression, reduced ROS formation, and protection from necrotic cell death. As 5ML exerted a cardioprotective effect, also independent of its inhibition of cellular ATRA uptake, the agent likely has another cardioprotective property, which may rely on the induction of TRX1 activity. In summary, this is the first study to show i) that local retinoids in the early MI zone may worsen disease outcome, ii) that inhibition of endothelial retinoid uptake using 5ML may constitute a novel treatment strategy, and iii) that targeting endothelial and myocardial retinoid uptake (e.g. via STRA6 inhibition) may constitute a novel treatment target in acute MI."
"Scrublet: Computational Identification of Cell Doublets in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has become a widely used, powerful approach for studying cell populations. However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets. Scrublet is freely available for download at github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet."
"AGA Clinical Practice Update on Diagnosis and Monitoring of Celiac Disease-Changing Utility of Serology and Histologic Measures: Expert Review. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical practice update is to define key modalities in the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease (CD) in adults as well as in children and adolescents. METHODS: The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on available published evidence, including cohort and case-control studies of the diagnostic process as well as controlled and descriptive studies of disease management. Best Practice Advice 1: Serology is a crucial component of the detection and diagnosis of CD, particularly tissue transglutaminase-immunoglobulin A (TG2-IgA), IgA testing, and less frequently, endomysial IgA testing. Best Practice Advice 2: Thorough histological analysis of duodenal biopsies with Marsh classification, counting of lymphocytes per high-power field, and morphometry is important for diagnosis as well as for differential diagnosis. Best Practice Advice 2a: TG2-IgA, at high levels (> x10 upper normal limit) is a reliable and accurate test for diagnosing active CD. When such a strongly positive TG2-IgA is combined with a positive endomysial antibody in a second blood sample, the positive predictive value for CD is virtually 100%. In adults, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and duodenal biopsies may then be performed for purposes of differential diagnosis. Best Practice Advice 3: IgA deficiency is an infrequent but important explanation for why patients with CD may be negative on IgA isotype testing despite strong suspicion. Measuring total IgA levels, IgG deamidated gliadin antibody tests, and TG2-IgG testing in that circumstance is recommended. Best Practice Advice 4: IgG isotype testing for TG2 antibody is not specific in the absence of IgA deficiency. Best Practice Advice 5: In patients found to have CD first by intestinal biopsies, celiac-specific serology should be undertaken as a confirmatory test before initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). Best Practice Advice 6: In patients in whom CD is strongly suspected in the face of negative biopsies, TG2-IgA should still be performed and, if positive, repeat biopsies might be considered either at that time or sometime in the future. Best Practice Advice 7: Reduction or avoidance of gluten before diagnostic testing is discouraged, as it may reduce the sensitivity of both serology and biopsy testing. Best Practice Advice 8: When patients have already started on a GFD before diagnosis, we suggest that the patient go back on a normal diet with 3 slices of wheat bread daily preferably for 1 to 3 months before repeat determination of TG2-IgA. Best Practice Advice 9: Determination of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has a limited role in the diagnosis of CD. Its value is largely related to its negative predictive value to rule out CD in patients who are seronegative in the face of histologic changes, in patients who did not have serologic confirmation at the time of diagnosis, and in those patients with a historic diagnosis of CD; especially as very young children before the introduction of celiac-specific serology. MANAGEMENT: Best Practice Advice 10: Celiac serology has a guarded role in the detection of continued intestinal injury, in particular as to sensitivity, as negative serology in a treated patient does not guarantee that the intestinal mucosa has healed. Persistently positive serology usually indicates ongoing intestinal damage and gluten exposure. Follow-up serology should be performed 6 and 12 months after diagnosis, and yearly thereafter. Best Practice Advice 11: Patients with persistent or relapsing symptoms, without other obvious explanations for those symptoms, should undergo endoscopic biopsies to determine healing even in the presence of negative TG2-IgA."
"Evaluation of algorithms for Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation: An open-access grand challenge. Knowledge of whole heart anatomy is a prerequisite for many clinical applications. Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of the heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be challenging due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of the clinical data. To achieve this goal, an initial set of training data is generally needed for constructing priors or for training. Furthermore, it is difficult to perform comparisons between different methods, largely due to differences in the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents the methodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the submissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provided 120 three-dimensional cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes, all acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms for CT data and eleven algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups, have been evaluated. The results showed that the performance of CT WHS was generally better than that of MRI WHS. The segmentation of the substructures for different categories of patients could present different levels of challenge due to the difference in imaging and variations of heart shapes. The deep learning (DL)-based methods demonstrated great potential, though several of them reported poor results in the blinded evaluation. Their performance could vary greatly across different network structures and training strategies. The conventional algorithms, mainly based on multi-atlas segmentation, demonstrated good performance, though the accuracy and computational efficiency could be limited. The challenge, including provision of the annotated training data and the blinded evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test data, continues as an ongoing benchmarking resource via its homepage (www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/)."
"Improving automated pediatric bone age estimation using ensembles of models from the 2017 RSNA machine learning challenge. Purpose: To investigate improvements in performance for automatic bone age estimation that can be gained through model ensembling. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 submissions from the 2017 RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge were used. Participants were provided with 12 611 pediatric hand radiographs with bone ages determined by a pediatric radiologist to develop models for bone age determination. The final results were determined using a test set of 200 radiographs labeled with the weighted average of six ratings. The mean pairwise model correlation and performance of all possible model combinations for ensembles of up to 10 models using the mean absolute deviation (MAD) were evaluated. A bootstrap analysis using the 200 test radiographs was conducted to estimate the true generalization MAD. Results: The estimated generalization MAD of a single model was 4.55 months. The best-performing ensemble consisted of four models with an MAD of 3.79 months. The mean pairwise correlation of models within this ensemble was 0.47. In comparison, the lowest achievable MAD by combining the highest-ranking models based on individual scores was 3.93 months using eight models with a mean pairwise model correlation of 0.67. Conclusion: Combining less-correlated, high-performing models resulted in better performance than naively combining the top-performing models. Machine learning competitions within radiology should be encouraged to spur development of heterogeneous models whose predictions can be combined to achieve optimal performance."
"Attention gated networks: Learning to leverage salient regions in medical images. We propose a novel attention gate (AG) model for medical image analysis that automatically learns to focus on target structures of varying shapes and sizes. Models trained with AGs implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for a specific task. This enables us to eliminate the necessity of using explicit external tissue/organ localisation modules when using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN models such as VGG or U-Net architectures with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed AG models are evaluated on a variety of tasks, including medical image classification and segmentation. For classification, we demonstrate the use case of AGs in scan plane detection for fetal ultrasound screening. We show that the proposed attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation while improving the overall prediction performance by reducing false positives. For segmentation, the proposed architecture is evaluated on two large 3D CT abdominal datasets with manual annotations for multiple organs. Experimental results show that AG models consistently improve the prediction performance of the base architectures across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. Moreover, AGs guide the model activations to be focused around salient regions, which provides better insights into how model predictions are made. The source code for the proposed AG models is publicly available."
"Clinical correlates of longitudinal MRI changes in CADASIL. Previous studies showed that various types of cerebral lesions, as assessed on MRI, largely contribute to the clinical severity of CADASIL. However, the clinical impact of longitudinal changes of classical markers of small vessel disease on conventional MRI has been only poorly investigated. One hundred sixty NOTCH3 mutation carriers (mean age Â± SD, 49.8 Â± 10.9 years) were followed over three years. Validated methods were used to determine the percent brain volume change (PBVC), number of incident lacunes, change of volume of white matter hyperintensities and change of number of cerebral microbleeds. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the independent association between changes of these MRI markers and incident clinical events. Mixed-effect multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess their association with changes of clinical scales. Over a mean period of 3.1 Â± 0.2 years, incident lacunes are found independently associated with incident stroke and change of Trail Making Test Part B. PBVC is independently associated with all incident events and clinical scale changes except the modified Rankin Scale at three years. Our results suggest that, on conventional MRI, PBVC and the number of incident lacunes are the most sensitive and independent correlates of clinical worsening over three years in CADASIL."
"Activation of Caspase-6 Is Promoted by a Mutant Huntingtin Fragment and Blocked by an Allosteric Inhibitor Compound. Aberrant activation of caspase-6 (C6) in the absence of other hallmarks of apoptosis has been demonstrated in cells and tissues from patients with Huntington disease (HD) and animal models. C6 activity correlates with disease progression in patients with HD and the cleavage of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein is thought to strongly contribute to disease pathogenesis. Here we show that the mHTT1-586 fragment generated by C6 cleavage interacts with the zymogen form of the enzyme, stabilizing a conformation that contains an active site and is prone to full activation. This shift toward enhanced activity can be prevented by a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks the interaction between C6 and mHTT1-586. Molecular docking studies suggest that the inhibitor binds an allosteric site in the C6 zymogen. The interaction of mHTT1-586 with C6 may therefore promote a self-reinforcing, feedforward cycle of C6 zymogen activation and mHTT cleavage driving HD pathogenesis."
"Deep Learning for Chest Radiograph Diagnosis in the Emergency Department. BackgroundThe performance of a deep learning (DL) algorithm should be validated in actual clinical situations, before its clinical implementation.PurposeTo evaluate the performance of a DL algorithm for identifying chest radiographs with clinically relevant abnormalities in the emergency department (ED) setting.Materials and MethodsThis single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients who visited the ED and underwent initial chest radiography between January 1 and March 31, 2017. Chest radiographs were analyzed with a commercially available DL algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity at predefined operating cutoffs (high-sensitivity and high-specificity cutoffs). The sensitivities and specificities of the algorithm were compared with those of the on-call radiology residents who interpreted the chest radiographs in the actual practice by using McNemar tests. If there were discordant findings between the algorithm and resident, the residents reinterpreted the chest radiographs by using the algorithm's output.ResultsA total of 1135 patients (mean age, 53 years +/- 18; 582 men) were evaluated. In the identification of abnormal chest radiographs, the algorithm showed an AUC of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 0.96), a sensitivity of 88.7% (227 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 84.1%, 92.3%), and a specificity of 69.6% (612 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 66.5%, 72.7%) at the high-sensitivity cutoff and a sensitivity of 81.6% (209 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 76.3%, 86.2%) and specificity of 90.3% (794 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 88.2%, 92.2%) at the high-specificity cutoff. Radiology residents showed lower sensitivity (65.6% [168 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 59.5%, 71.4%], P < .001) and higher specificity (98.1% [862 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 96.9%, 98.9%], P < .001) compared with the algorithm. After reinterpretation of chest radiographs with use of the algorithm's outputs, the sensitivity of the residents improved (73.4% [188 of 256 radiographs; 95% CI: 68.0%, 78.8%], P = .003), whereas specificity was reduced (94.3% [829 of 879 radiographs; 95% CI: 92.8%, 95.8%], P < .001).ConclusionA deep learning algorithm used with emergency department chest radiographs showed diagnostic performance for identifying clinically relevant abnormalities and helped improve the sensitivity of radiology residents' evaluation.Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Munera and Infante in this issue."
"Deep learning in ophthalmology: The technical and clinical considerations. The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the internet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally."
"Development of a Selective CDK7 Covalent Inhibitor Reveals Predominant Cell-Cycle Phenotype. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) regulates both cell cycle and transcription, but its precise role remains elusive. We previously described THZ1, a CDK7 inhibitor, which dramatically inhibits superenhancer-associated gene expression. However, potent CDK12/13 off-target activity obscured CDK7s contribution to this phenotype. Here, we describe the discovery of a highly selective covalent CDK7 inhibitor. YKL-5-124 causes arrest at the G1/S transition and inhibition of E2F-driven gene expression; these effects are rescued by a CDK7 mutant unable to covalently engage YKL-5-124, demonstrating on-target specificity. Unlike THZ1, treatment with YKL-5-124 resulted in no change to RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphorylation; however, inhibition could be reconstituted by combining YKL-5-124 and THZ531, a selective CDK12/13 inhibitor, revealing potential redundancies in CDK control of gene transcription. These findings highlight the importance of CDK7/12/13 polypharmacology for anti-cancer activity of THZ1 and posit that selective inhibition of CDK7 may be useful for treatment of cancers marked by E2F misregulation. Olson et al. describe the development and characterization of YKL-5-124, a potent, selective, and covalent CDK7 inhibitor. YKL-5-124 displays biochemical and cellular selectivity for CDK7 over CDK12/13, structurally related kinases. CDK7 inhibition by YKL-5-124 induces a strong cell-cycle arrest and a surprisingly weak effect on RNA Pol II phosphorylation."
"Dysregulation of RNA Splicing in Tauopathies. Pathological aggregation of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) is associated with dysregulation of RNA splicing in PS19 P301S tau transgenic mice and in Alzheimer's disease brain tissues. The dysregulated splicing particularly affects genes involved in synaptic transmission. The effects of neuroprotective TIA1 reduction on PS19 mice are also examined. TIA1 reduction reduces disease-linked alternative splicing events for the major synaptic mRNA transcripts examined, suggesting that normalization of RBP functions is associated with the neuroprotection. Use of the NetDecoder informatics algorithm identifies key upstream biological targets, including MYC and EGFR, underlying the transcriptional and splicing changes in the protected compared to tauopathy mice. Pharmacological inhibition of MYC and EGFR activity in neuronal cultures tau recapitulates the neuroprotective effects of TIA1 reduction. These results demonstrate that dysfunction of RBPs and RNA splicing processes are major elements of the pathophysiology of tauopathies, as well as potential therapeutic targets for tauopathies."
"Intracellular MLCK1 diversion reverses barrier loss to restore mucosal homeostasis. Epithelial barrier loss is a driver of intestinal and systemic diseases. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a key effector of barrier dysfunction and a potential therapeutic target, but enzymatic inhibition has unacceptable toxicity. Here, we show that a unique domain within the MLCK splice variant MLCK1 directs perijunctional actomyosin ring (PAMR) recruitment. Using the domain structure and multiple screens, we identify a domain-binding small molecule (divertin) that blocks MLCK1 recruitment without inhibiting enzymatic function. Divertin blocks acute, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced MLCK1 recruitment as well as downstream myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, barrier loss, and diarrhea in vitro and in vivo. Divertin corrects barrier dysfunction and prevents disease development and progression in experimental inflammatory bowel disease. Beyond applications of divertin in gastrointestinal disease, this general approach to enzymatic inhibition by preventing access to specific subcellular sites provides a new paradigm for safely and precisely targeting individual properties of enzymes with multiple functions."
"Incorporating medical code descriptions for diagnosis prediction in healthcare. BACKGROUND: Diagnosis aims to predict the future health status of patients according to their historical electronic health records (EHR), which is an important yet challenging task in healthcare informatics. Existing diagnosis prediction approaches mainly employ recurrent neural networks (RNN) with attention mechanisms to make predictions. However, these approaches ignore the importance of code descriptions, i.e., the medical definitions of diagnosis codes. We believe that taking diagnosis code descriptions into account can help the state-of-the-art models not only to learn meaning code representations, but also to improve the predictive performance, especially when the EHR data are insufficient. METHODS: We propose a simple, but general diagnosis prediction framework, which includes two basic components: diagnosis code embedding and predictive model. To learn the interpretable code embeddings, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to model medical descriptions of diagnosis codes extracted from online medical websites. The learned medical embedding matrix is used to embed the input visits into vector representations, which are fed into the predictive models. Any existing diagnosis prediction approach (referred to as the base model) can be cast into the proposed framework as the predictive model (called the enhanced model). RESULTS: We conduct experiments on two real medical datasets: the MIMIC-III dataset and the Heart Failure claim dataset. Experimental results show that the enhanced diagnosis prediction approaches significantly improve the prediction performance. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with insufficient EHR data. Finally, we visualize the learned medical code embeddings to show the interpretability of the proposed framework. CONCLUSIONS: Given the historical visit records of a patient, the proposed framework is able to predict the next visit information by incorporating medical code descriptions."
"Identification and weighting of kidney allocation criteria: a novel multi-expert fuzzy method. BACKGROUND: Kidney allocation is a multi-criteria and complex decision-making problem, which should also consider ethical issues in addition to the medical aspects. Leading countries in this field use a point scoring system to allocate kidneys. Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify and weight the kidney allocation criteria considering the balance between utility and equity. METHODS: To do this, a new fuzzy hybrid approach is proposed, which consists of two steps: In the first step, Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is used to identify the effective criteria in the kidney allocation algorithm. In the second step, Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (IF-AHP) is employed to determine the weight of the criteria. RESULTS: The results showed that the highest weight belongs to ""Medical emergency"" criterion and the lowest weight to ""5 HLA mismatches"", which is similar to Euro-transplant kidney allocation system (ETKAS). The developed method is evaluated in two steps. First, the proposed model is implemented using a real case study from the Iranian Kidney Allocation System. It was shown that the proposed model has the potential to improve allocation outcome. Second, the proposed model's superiority to the current model is approved by the experts using the results display in the profile matrix. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. CONCLUSIONS: This paper contributes to the kidney allocation literature by doing the following: (a) developing a comprehensive framework for identification and weightings of criteria for kidney allocation, (b) using, for the first time, the IF-AHP technique to consider hesitancy of decision makers and uncertainty in organ allocation, and (c) proposing an appropriate framework for the countries that intend to improve or modify their organ allocation system."
"DoubletDecon: Deconvoluting Doublets from Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data. Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell types can appear as hybrid scRNA-seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic, mixed-species, genetic, and cell-hashing cell doublets from scRNA-seq datasets of varying cellular complexity with a high sensitivity relative to alternative approaches. Importantly, this algorithm prevents the prediction of valid mixed-lineage and transitional cell states as doublets by considering their unique gene expression. DoubletDecon has an easy-to-use graphical user interface and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms."
"Genetically elevated circulating homocysteine concentrations increase the risk of diabetic kidney disease in Chinese diabetic patients. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a devastating and frequent complication of diabetes mellitus. Here, we first adopted methylenetetrahytrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphism as an instrument to infer the possible causal relevance between circulating homocysteine and DKD risk in a Chinese population and next attempted to build a risk prediction model for DKD. This is a hospital-based case-control association study. Total 1107 study participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 547 patients with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed DKD. MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism was determined using the TaqMan method. Carriers of 677TT genotype (14.55Â Î¼mol/L) had significantly higher homocysteine concentrations than carriers of 677CT genotype (12.88Â Î¼mol/L) (PÂ <Â 0.001). Carriers of 677TT genotype had a 1.57-fold increased risk of DKD (odds ratio: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.21-2.05, PÂ =Â 0.001) relative to carriers of 677CT genotype after adjusting for confounders. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that the odds ratio for DKD relative to diabetes mellitus per 5Â Î¼mol/L increment of circulating homocysteine concentrations was 3.86 (95% confidence interval: 1.21-2.05, PÂ <Â 0.001). In the Logistic regression analysis, hypertension, homocysteine and triglyceride were significantly associated with an increased risk of DKD and they constituted a risk prediction model with good test performance and discriminatory capacity. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that elevated circulating homocysteine concentrations were causally associated with an increased risk of DKD in Chinese diabetic patients."
"Deep Learning and Glaucoma Specialists: The Relative Importance of Optic Disc Features to Predict Glaucoma Referral in Fundus Photographs. PURPOSE: To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm that predicts referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) and optic nerve head (ONH) features from color fundus images, to determine the relative importance of these features in referral decisions by glaucoma specialists (GSs) and the algorithm, and to compare the performance of the algorithm with eye care providers. DESIGN: Development and validation of an algorithm. PARTICIPANTS: Fundus images from screening programs, studies, and a glaucoma clinic. METHODS: A DL algorithm was trained using a retrospective dataset of 86 618 images, assessed for glaucomatous ONH features and referable GON (defined as ONH appearance worrisome enough to justify referral for comprehensive examination) by 43 graders. The algorithm was validated using 3 datasets: dataset A (1205 images, 1 image/patient; 18.1% referable), images adjudicated by panels of GSs; dataset B (9642 images, 1 image/patient; 9.2% referable), images from a diabetic teleretinal screening program; and dataset C (346 images, 1 image/patient; 81.7% referable), images from a glaucoma clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The algorithm was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable GON and glaucomatous ONH features. RESULTS: The algorithm's AUC for referable GON was 0.945 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.929-0.960) in dataset A, 0.855 (95% CI, 0.841-0.870) in dataset B, and 0.881 (95% CI, 0.838-0.918) in dataset C. Algorithm AUCs ranged between 0.661 and 0.973 for glaucomatous ONH features. The algorithm showed significantly higher sensitivity than 7 of 10 graders not involved in determining the reference standard, including 2 of 3 GSs, and showed higher specificity than 3 graders (including 1 GS), while remaining comparable to others. For both GSs and the algorithm, the most crucial features related to referable GON were: presence of vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more, neuroretinal rim notching, retinal nerve fiber layer defect, and bared circumlinear vessels. CONCLUSIONS: A DL algorithm trained on fundus images alone can detect referable GON with higher sensitivity than and comparable specificity to eye care providers. The algorithm maintained good performance on an independent dataset with diagnoses based on a full glaucoma workup."
