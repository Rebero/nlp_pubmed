"Sample size calculations for model validation in linear regression analysis. BACKGROUND: Linear regression analysis is a widely used statistical technique in practical applications. For planning and appraising validation studies of simple linear regression, an approximate sample size formula has been proposed for the joint test of intercept and slope coefficients. METHODS: The purpose of this article is to reveal the potential drawback of the existing approximation and to provide an alternative and exact solution of power and sample size calculations for model validation in linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A fetal weight example is included to illustrate the underlying discrepancy between the exact and approximate methods. Moreover, extensive numerical assessments were conducted to examine the relative performance of the two distinct procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the exact approach has a distinct advantage over the current method with greater accuracy and high robustness."
"Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia. X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is the most common cause of inherited phosphate wasting and is associated with severe complications such as rickets, lower limb deformities, pain, poor mineralization of the teeth and disproportionate short stature in children as well as hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, enthesopathies, osteoarthritis and pseudofractures in adults. The characteristics and severity of XLH vary between patients. Because of its rarity, the diagnosis and specific treatment of XLH are frequently delayed, which has a detrimental effect on patient outcomes. In this Evidence-Based Guideline, we recommend that the diagnosis of XLH is based on signs of rickets and/or osteomalacia in association with hypophosphataemia and renal phosphate wasting in the absence of vitamin D or calcium deficiency. Whenever possible, the diagnosis should be confirmed by molecular genetic analysis or measurement of levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) before treatment. Owing to the multisystemic nature of the disease, patients should be seen regularly by multidisciplinary teams organized by a metabolic bone disease expert. In this article, we summarize the current evidence and provide recommendations on features of the disease, including new treatment modalities, to improve knowledge and provide guidance for diagnosis and multidisciplinary care."
"A network embedding model for pathogenic genes prediction by multi-path random walking on heterogeneous network. Background: Prediction of pathogenic genes is crucial for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. But traditional genetic localization methods are often technique-difficulty and time-consuming. With the development of computer science, computational biology has gradually become one of the main methods for finding candidate pathogenic genes. Methods: We propose a pathogenic genes prediction method based on network embedding which is called Multipath2vec. Firstly, we construct an heterogeneous network which is called GP-network. It is constructed based on three kinds of relationships between genes and phenotypes, including correlations between phenotypes, interactions between genes and known gene-phenotype pairs. Then in order to embedding the network better, we design the multi-path to guide random walk in GP-network. The multi-path includes multiple paths between genes and phenotypes which can capture complex structural information of heterogeneous network. Finally, we use the learned vector representation of each phenotype and protein to calculate the similarities and rank according to the similarities between candidate genes and the target phenotype. Results: We implemented Multipath2vec and four baseline approaches (i.e., CATAPULT, PRINCE, Deepwalk and Metapath2vec) on many-genes gene-phenotype data, single-gene gene-phenotype data and whole gene-phenotype data. Experimental results show that Multipath2vec outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines in pathogenic genes prediction task. Conclusions: We propose Multipath2vec that can be utilized to predict pathogenic genes and experimental results show the higher accuracy of pathogenic genes prediction."
"Apolipoprotein AI) Promotes Atherosclerosis Regression in Diabetic Mice by Suppressing Myelopoiesis and Plaque Inflammation. BACKGROUND: Despite robust cholesterol lowering, cardiovascular disease risk remains increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Consistent with this, diabetes mellitus impairs atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering in humans and mice. In mice, this is attributed in part to hyperglycemia-induced monocytosis, which increases monocyte entry into plaques despite cholesterol lowering. In addition, diabetes mellitus skews plaque macrophages toward an atherogenic inflammatory M1 phenotype instead of toward the atherosclerosis-resolving M2 state typical with cholesterol lowering. Functional high-density lipoprotein (HDL), typically low in patients with diabetes mellitus, reduces monocyte precursor proliferation in murine bone marrow and has anti-inflammatory effects on human and murine macrophages. Our study aimed to test whether raising functional HDL levels in diabetic mice prevents monocytosis, reduces the quantity and inflammation of plaque macrophages, and enhances atherosclerosis regression after cholesterol lowering. METHODS: Aortic arches containing plaques developed in Ldlr(-/-) mice were transplanted into either wild-type, diabetic wild-type, or diabetic mice transgenic for human apolipoprotein AI, which have elevated functional HDL. Recipient mice all had low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to promote plaque regression. After 2 weeks, plaques in recipient mouse aortic grafts were examined. RESULTS: Diabetic wild-type mice had impaired atherosclerosis regression, which was normalized by raising HDL levels. This benefit was linked to suppressed hyperglycemia-driven myelopoiesis, monocytosis, and neutrophilia. Increased HDL improved cholesterol efflux from bone marrow progenitors, suppressing their proliferation and monocyte and neutrophil production capacity. In addition to reducing circulating monocytes available for recruitment into plaques, in the diabetic milieu, HDL suppressed the general recruitability of monocytes to inflammatory sites and promoted plaque macrophage polarization to the M2, atherosclerosis-resolving state. There was also a decrease in plaque neutrophil extracellular traps, which are atherogenic and increased by diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Raising apolipoprotein AI and functional levels of HDL promotes multiple favorable changes in the production of monocytes and neutrophils and in the inflammatory environment of atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice after cholesterol lowering and may represent a novel approach to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in people with diabetes mellitus."
"A network clustering based feature selection strategy for classifying autism spectrum disorder. Background: Advanced non-invasive neuroimaging techniques offer new approaches to study functions and structures of human brains. Whole-brain functional networks obtained from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging has been widely used to study brain diseases like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Auto-classification of ASD has become an important issue. Existing classification methods for ASD are based on features extracted from the whole-brain functional networks, which may be not discriminant enough for good performance. Methods: In this study, we propose a network clustering based feature selection strategy for classifying ASD. In our proposed method, we first apply symmetric non-negative matrix factorization to divide brain networks into four modules. Then we extract features from one of four modules called default mode network (DMN) and use them to train several classifiers for ASD classification. Results: The computational experiments show that our proposed method achieves better performances than those trained with features extracted from the whole brain network. Conclusion: It is a good strategy to train the classifiers for ASD based on features from the default mode subnetwork."
"Heterotypic docking compatibility of human connexin37 with other vascular connexins. Human vascular connexins (Cx37, Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45) can form various types of gap junction channels to synchronize vasodilation/constriction to control local circulation. Most of our knowledge on heterotypic gap junctions of these vascular connexins was from studies on rodent connexins. In human vasculature, the same four homolog connexins exist, but whether these human connexins can form heterotypic GJs as those of rodents have not been fully studied. Here we used in vitro expression system to study the coupling status and GJ channel properties of human heterotypic Cx37/Cx40, Cx37/Cx43, and Cx37/Cx45 GJs. Our results showed that Cx37/Cx43 and Cx37/Cx45 GJs, but not Cx37/Cx40 GJs, were functional and each with unique rectifying channel properties. The failure of docking between Cx37 and Cx40 could be rescued by designed Cx40 variants. Characterization of the heterotypic Cx37/Cx43 and Cx37/Cx45 GJs may help us in understanding the intercellular communication at the myoendothelial junction."
"Single-Cell Transcriptomics Uncovers Glial Progenitor Diversity and Cell Fate Determinants during Development and Gliomagenesis. By applying lineage-targeted, single-cell transcriptomics analysis, Weng and colleagues uncover distinct intermediate glial progenitors in the neonatal brain and their malignant counterparts in murine and human gliomas. Lineage-driving network analysis further identifies Zfp36l1 as a pivotal regulator for glial fate specification and glioma growth."
"NBS1 interacts with HP1 to ensure genome integrity. Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex are conserved factors that play crucial role in genome stability and integrity. Despite their involvement in overlapping cellular functions, ranging from chromatin organization, telomere maintenance to DNA replication and repair, a tight functional relationship between HP1 and the MRN complex has never been elucidated. Here we show that the Drosophila HP1a protein binds to the MRN complex through its chromoshadow domain (CSD). In addition, loss of any of the MRN members reduces HP1a levels indicating that the MRN complex acts as regulator of HP1a stability. Moreover, overexpression of HP1a in nbs (but not in rad50 or mre11) mutant cells drastically reduces DNA damage associated with the loss of Nbs suggesting that HP1a and Nbs work in concert to maintain chromosome integrity in flies. We have also found that human HP1Î± and NBS1 interact with each other and that, similarly to Drosophila, siRNA-mediated inhibition of NBS1 reduces HP1Î± levels in human cultured cells. Surprisingly, fibroblasts from Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) patients, carrying the 657del5 hypomorphic mutation in NBS1 and expressing the p26 and p70 NBS1 fragments, accumulate HP1Î± indicating that, differently from NBS1 knockout cells, the presence of truncated NBS1 extends HP1Î± turnover and/or promotes its stability. Remarkably, an siRNA-mediated reduction of HP1Î± in NBS fibroblasts decreases the hypersensitivity to irradiation, a characteristic of the NBS syndrome. Overall, our data provide an unanticipated evidence of a close interaction between HP1 and NBS1 that is essential for genome stability and point up HP1Î± as a potential target to counteract chromosome instability in NBS patient cells."
"NMR structure determination of Ixolaris and factor X(a) interaction reveals a noncanonical mechanism of Kunitz inhibition. Ixolaris is a potent tick salivary anticoagulant that binds coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and zymogen FX, with formation of a quaternary tissue factor (TF)/FVIIa/ FX(a)/Ixolaris inhibitory complex. Ixolaris blocks TF-induced coagulation and PAR2 signaling and prevents thrombosis, tumor growth, and immune activation. We present a high-resolution structure and dynamics of Ixolaris and describe the structural basis for recognition of FX. Ixolaris consists of 2 Kunitz domains (K1 and K2) in which K2 is strikingly dynamic and encompasses several residues involved in FX binding. This indicates that the backbone plasticity of K2 is critical for Ixolaris biological activity. Notably, a nuclear magnetic resonanceâ€“derived model reveals a mechanism for an electrostatically guided, high-affinity interaction between Ixolaris and FX heparin-binding (pro)exosite, resulting in an allosteric switch in the catalytic site. This is the first report revealing the structure-function relationship of an anticoagulant targeting a zymogen serving as a scaffold for TF inhibition."
"Automatic needle detection and real-time Bi-planar needle visualization during 3D ultrasound scanning of the liver. 2D ultrasound (US) image guidance is used in minimally invasive procedures in the liver to visualize the target and the needle. Needle insertion using 2D ultrasound keeping the transducer position to view needle and reach target is challenging. Dedicated needle holders attached to the US transducer help to target in plane and at a specific angle. A drawback of this is that, the probe is fixed to the needle and cannot be rotated to assess the position of the needle in a perpendicular plane. In this study, we propose an automatic needle detection and tracking method using 3D US imaging to improve image guidance and visualization of the target in the liver with respect to the needle during these interventional procedures. The method utilizes a convolutional neural network for detection of the needle in 3D US images. In a subsequent step, the output of the convolutional neural network is used to detect needle candidates, which are fed into a final tracking step to determine the real needle position. The needle position is used to present two perpendicular cross-sectional planes of the 3D US image containing the needle in both directions. Performance of the method was evaluated in phantoms and in-vivo data by calculating the needle position distance and needle orientation angle between segmented needles and reference ground truth needles, which were manually annotated by an observer. The method successfully detects the needle position and orientation with mean errors of 1mm and 2 degrees , respectively. The proposed method yields a robust automatic needle detection and visualization at a frame rate of 3Hz in 3D ultrasound imaging of the liver."
"Phase contrast mapping MRI measurements of global cerebral blood flow across different perfusion states â€“ A direct comparison with 15O-H2O positron emission tomography using a hybrid PET/MR system. Phase-contrast mapping (PCM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides easy-access non-invasive quantification of global cerebral blood flow (gCBF) but its accuracy in altered perfusion states is not established. We aimed to compare paired PCM MRI and 15O-H2O positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of gCBF in different perfusion states in a single scanning session. Duplicate combined gCBF PCM-MRI and 15O-H2O PET measurements were performed in the resting condition, during hyperventilation and after acetazolamide administration (post-ACZ) using a 3T hybrid PET/MR system. A total of 62 paired gCBF measurements were acquired in 14 healthy young male volunteers. Average gCBF in resting state measured by PCM-MRI and 15O-H2O PET were 58.5 Â± 10.7 and 38.6 Â± 5.7 mL/100 g/min, respectively, during hyperventilation 33 Â± 8.6 and 24.7 Â± 5.8 mL/100 g/min, respectively, and post-ACZ 89.6 Â± 27.1 and 57.3 Â± 9.6 mL/100 g/min, respectively. On average, gCBF measured by PCM-MRI was 49% higher compared to 15O-H2O PET. A strong correlation between the two methods across all states was observed (R2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). Blandâ€“Altman analysis suggested a perfusion dependent relative bias resulting in higher relative difference at higher CBF values. In conclusion, measurements of gCBF by PCM-MRI in healthy volunteers show a strong correlation with 15O-H2O PET, but are associated with a large and non-linear perfusion-dependent difference."
"Variation in Follow-up Imaging Recommendations in Radiology Reports: Patient, Modality, and Radiologist Predictors. Background Variation between radiologists when making recommendations for additional imaging and associated factors are, to the knowledge of the authors, unknown. Clear identification of factors that account for variation in follow-up recommendations might prevent unnecessary tests for incidental or ambiguous image findings. Purpose To determine incidence and identify factors associated with follow-up recommendations in radiology reports from multiple modalities, patient care settings, and imaging divisions. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed 318 366 reports obtained from diagnostic imaging examinations performed at a large urban quaternary care hospital from January 1 to December 31, 2016, excluding breast and US reports. A subset of 1000 reports were randomly selected and manually annotated to train and validate a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a report included a follow-up imaging recommendation (training-and-validation set consisted of 850 reports and test set of 150 reports). The trained algorithm was used to classify 318 366 reports. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of follow-up recommendation. Additional analysis by imaging subspecialty division was performed, and intradivision and interradiologist variability was quantified. Results The machine learning algorithm classified 38 745 of 318 366 (12.2%) reports as containing follow-up recommendations. Average patient age was 59 years +/- 17 (standard deviation); 45.2% (143 767 of 318 366) of reports were from male patients. Among 65 radiologists, 57% (37 of 65) were men. At multivariable analysis, older patients had higher rates of follow-up recommendations (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.01, 1.01] for each additional year), male patients had lower rates of follow-up recommendations (OR, 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.0), and follow-up recommendations were most common among CT studies (OR, 4.2 [95% CI: 4.0, 4.4] compared with radiography). Radiologist sex (P = .54), presence of a trainee (P = .45), and years in practice (P = .49) were not significant predictors overall. A division-level analysis showed 2.8-fold to 6.7-fold interradiologist variation. Conclusion Substantial interradiologist variation exists in the probability of recommending a follow-up examination in a radiology report, after adjusting for patient, examination, and radiologist factors.

"Urinary stone detection on ct images using deep convolutional neural networks: Evaluation of model performance and generalization. Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of cascading convolutional neural network (CNN) for urinary stone detection on unenhanced CT images and to evaluate the performance of pretrained models enriched with labeled CT images across different scanners. Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review boardâ€“approved, retrospective clinical study used unenhanced abdominopelvic CT scans from 535 adults suspected of having urolithiasis. The scans were obtained on two scanners (scanner 1 [hereafter S1] and scanner 2 [hereafter S2]). A radiologist reviewed clinical reports and labeled cases for determination of reference standard. Stones were present on 279 (S1, 131; S2, 148) and absent on 256 (S1, 158; S2, 98) scans. One hundred scans (50 from each scanner) were randomly reserved as the test dataset, and the rest were used for developing a cascade of two CNNs: The first CNN identified the extent of the urinary tract, and the second CNN detected presence of stone. Nine variations of models were developed through the combination of different training data sources (S1, S2, or both [hereafter SB]) with (ImageNet, GrayNet) and without (Random) pretrained CNNs. First, models were compared for generalizability at the section level. Second, models were assessed by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy at the patient level with test dataset from both scanners (n = 100). Results: The GrayNet-pretrained model showed higher classifier exactness than did ImageNet-pretrained or Random-initialized models when tested by using data from the same or different scanners at section level. At the patient level, the AUC for stone detection was 0.92â€“0.95, depending on the model. Accuracy of GrayNet-SB (95%) was higher than that of ImageNet-SB (91%) and Random-SB (88%). For stones larger than 4 mm, all models showed similar performance (false-negative results: Two of 34). For stones smaller than 4 mm, the number of false-negative results for GrayNet-SB, ImageNet-SB, and Random-SB were one of 16, three of 16, and five of 16, respectively. GrayNet-SB identified stones in all 22 test cases that had obstructive uropathy. Conclusion: A cascading model of CNNs can detect urinary tract stones on unenhanced CT scans with a high accuracy (AUC, 0.954). Performance and generalization of CNNs across scanners can be enhanced by using transfer learning with datasets enriched with labeled medical images."
"Modeling Surgical Technical Skill Using Expert Assessment for Automated Computer Rating. OBJECTIVE: Computer vision was used to predict expert performance ratings from surgeon hand motions for tying and suturing tasks. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Existing methods, including the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS), have proven reliable, but do not readily discriminate at the task level. Computer vision may be used for evaluating distinct task performance throughout an operation. METHODS: Open surgeries was videoed and surgeon hands were tracked without using sensors or markers. An expert panel of 3 attending surgeons rated tying and suturing video clips on continuous scales from 0 to 10 along 3 task measures adapted from the broader OSATS: motion economy, fluidity of motion, and tissue handling. Empirical models were developed to predict the expert consensus ratings based on the hand kinematic data records. RESULTS: The predicted versus panel ratings for suturing had slopes from 0.73 to 1, and intercepts from 0.36 to 1.54 (Average R2 = 0.81). Predicted versus panel ratings for tying had slopes from 0.39 to 0.88, and intercepts from 0.79 to 4.36 (Average R2 = 0.57). The mean square error among predicted and expert ratings was consistently less than the mean squared difference among individual expert ratings and the eventual consensus ratings. CONCLUSIONS: The computer algorithm consistently predicted the panel ratings of individual tasks, and were more objective and reliable than individual assessment by surgical experts."
"Simulation-based training of junior doctors in handling critically ill patients facilitates the transition to clinical practice: an interview study. BACKGROUND: Junior doctors lack confidence and competence in handling the critically ill patient including diagnostic skills, decision-making and team working with other health care professionals. Simulation-based training on managing emergency situations can have substantial effects on satisfaction and learning. However, there are indications of problems when applying learned skills to practice. Our aim was to identify first-year doctors' perceptions, reflections and experiences on transfer of skills to a clinical setting after simulation-based training in handling critically ill patients. METHODS: We used a qualitative approach and conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with a sample of twenty first-year doctors six months after a 4-day simulation-based training course in handling critically ill patients. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. A content-analysis approach was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The following main themes were identified from the interviews: preparedness for clinical practice, organisational readiness, use of algorithms, communication, teamwork, situational awareness and decision making. The doctors gave several examples of simulation-based training increasing their preparedness for clinical practice and handling the critically ill patient. The usefulness of algorithms and the appreciation of non-technical skills were highlighted and found to be helpful in managing clinical difficulties. Concern was expressed related to staff willingness and preparedness in using these tools. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the simulation-based training seemed to facilitate the transition from being a medical student to become a junior doctor. The doctors experienced an ability to transfer the use of algorithms and non-technical skills trained in the simulated environment to the clinical environment. However, the application of these skills was more difficult if these skills were unfamiliar to the surrounding clinical staff. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable."
"In silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulation of human superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) genetic variants. Oxidative stress is a major factor in aging processes. Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) plays a key role in the protection of extracellular oxidative stress. Missense mutations in SOD3 have been described to be associated with the occurrence of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases. This study aims to analyze the effects of missense mutations on the SOD3 structure and function by modeling a complete SOD3 structure as well as analyzing the differences between the wild-types and mutants using computational simulations. Here, ten algorithms were used to predict the structural and functional effects of missense mutations. A complete model of SOD3 protein was made by ab initio and comparative modeling using the Rosetta algorithm and validated by PROCHECK, Verify 3D, QMEAN, and ProSa. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed and analyzed using the GROMACS package. The deleterious potential of the A58T and R231G mutants was not predicted by the majority of the used algorithms. The analyzed mutations were predicted as destabilizing by at least one algorithm. The MD analyses indicated that protein flexibility may be increased by all of the analyzed mutations, while the protein-ligand stability may be decreased. They also suggested that the variants A91T and R231G increase the overall dimensions of SOD3 and decrease its accessible surface area. Our findings, therefore, indicated that the analyzed mutations could affect the protein structure and its ability to interact with other molecules, which may be related to the functional impairment of SOD3 upon A58T and R231G mutations, as well as their involvement in pathologies."
"Small molecule glycomimetics inhibit vascular calcification via c-Met/Notch3/HES1 signalling. Background/Aims: Vascular calcification represents a huge clinical problem contributing to adverse cardiovascular events, with no effective treatment currently available. Upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor has been linked with vascular calcification, and thus, represent a potential target in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy. Glycomimetics have been shown to interrupt HGF-receptor signalling, therefore this study investigated the effect of novel glycomimetics on osteogenic signalling and vascular calcification in vitro. Methods: Primary human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs) were induced by Î²-glycerophosphate (Î²-GP) and treated with 4 glycomimetic compounds (C1-C4). The effect of Î²-GP and C1-C4 on alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteogenic markers and c-Met/Notch3/HES1 signalling was determined using colorimetric assays, qRT-PCR and western blotting respectively. Results: C1-C4 significantly attenuated Î²-GP-induced calcification, as shown by Alizarin Red S staining and calcium content by day 14. In addition, C1-C4 reduced ALP activity and prevented upregulation of the osteogenic markers, BMP-2, Runx2, Msx2 and OPN. Furthermore, Î²-GP increased c-Met phosphorylation at day 21, an effect ameliorated by C2 and C4 and the c-Met inhibitor, crizotinib. We next interrogated the effects of the Notch inhibitor DAPT and confirmed an inhibition of Î²-GP up-regulated Notch3 protein by C2, DAPT and crizotinib compared to controls. Hes-1 protein upregulation by Î²-GP, was also significantly downregulated by C2 and DAPT. GOLD docking analysis identified a potential binding interaction of C1-C4 to HGF which will be investigated further. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that glycomimetics have potent anti-calcification properties acting via HGF/c-Met and Notch signalling."
"Gliomasphere marker combinatorics: multidimensional flow cytometry detects CD44+/CD133+/ITGA6+/CD36+ signature. Glioblastoma is the most dangerous brain cancer. One reason for glioblastoma's aggressiveness are glioblastoma stem-like cells. To target them, a number of markers have been proposed (CD133, CD44, CD15, A2B5, CD36, CXCR4, IL6R, L1CAM, and ITGA6). A comprehensive study of co-expression patterns of them has, however, not been performed so far. Here, we mapped the multidimensional co-expression profile of these stemness-associated molecules. Gliomaspheres â€“ an established model of glioblastoma stem-like cells â€“ were used. Seven different gliomasphere systems were subjected to multicolor flow cytometry measuring the nine markers CD133, CD44, CD15, A2B5, CD36, CXCR4, IL6R, L1CAM, and ITGA6 all simultaneously based on a novel 9-marker multicolor panel developed for this study. The viSNE dimensionality reduction algorithm was applied for analysis. All gliomaspheres were found to express at least five different glioblastoma stem-like cell markers. Multi-dimensional analysis showed that all studied gliomaspheres consistently harbored a cell population positive for the molecular signature CD44+/CD133+/ITGA6+/CD36+. Glioblastoma patients with an enrichment of this combination had a significantly worse survival outcome when analyzing the two largest available The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets (MIT/Harvard Affymetrix: PÂ =Â 0.0015, University of North Carolina Agilent: PÂ =Â 0.0322). In sum, we detected a previously unknown marker combination â€“ demonstrating feasibility, usefulness, and importance of high-dimensional gliomasphere marker combinatorics."
"Use of electronic health record data and machine learning to identify candidates for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis: a modelling study. BACKGROUND: The limitations of existing HIV risk prediction tools are a barrier to implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We developed and validated an HIV prediction model to identify potential PrEP candidates in a large health-care system. METHODS: Our study population was HIV-uninfected adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health-care system, who were not yet using PrEP and had at least 2 years of previous health plan enrolment with at least one outpatient visit from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2017. Using 81 electronic health record (EHR) variables, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to predict incident HIV diagnosis within 3 years on a subset of patients who entered the cohort in 2007-14 (development dataset), assessing ten-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and 95% CIs. We compared the full model to simpler models including only men who have sex with men (MSM) status and sexually transmitted infection (STI) positivity, testing, and treatment. Models were validated prospectively with data from an independent set of patients who entered the cohort in 2015-17. We computed predicted probabilities of incident HIV diagnosis within 3 years (risk scores), categorised as low risk (<0.05%), moderate risk (0.05% to <0.20%), high risk (0.20% to <1.0%), and very high risk (>/=1.0%), for all patients in the validation dataset. FINDINGS: Of 3 750 664 patients in 2007-17 (3 143 963 in the development dataset and 606 701 in the validation dataset), there were 784 incident HIV cases within 3 years of baseline. The LASSO procedure retained 44 predictors in the full model, with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87) for incident HIV cases in 2007-14. Model performance remained high in the validation dataset (AUC 0.84, 0.80-0.89). The full model outperformed simpler models including only MSM status and STI positivity. For the full model, flagging 13 463 (2.2%) patients with high or very high HIV risk scores in the validation dataset identified 32 (38.6%) of the 83 incident HIV cases, including 32 (46.4%) of 69 male cases and none of the 14 female cases. The full model had equivalent sensitivity by race whereas simpler models identified fewer black than white HIV cases. INTERPRETATION: Prediction models using EHR data can identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition who could benefit from PrEP. Future studies should optimise EHR-based HIV risk prediction tools and evaluate their effect on prescription of PrEP.

"FtsA as a cidal target for Staphylococcus aureus: Molecular docking and dynamics studies. Staphylococcus aureus infection is a healthcare problem to mankind for a considerable period of time. Once when it enters the bloodstream of an individual, it may potentially result in life-threatening conditions. The resistance of S. aureus to various drugs such as penicillin, methicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, and tetracycline have been well documented. Presently vancomycin is the drug of choice for methicillin resistant S. aureus. Scientists believe that S. aureus would completely develop resistance to vancomycin as well. Therefore there is a commensurate need to develop a drug to replace vancomycin. In the current study, we have focussed on FtsA, an important and vital cell division protein, which is found only in S. aureus and in other prokaryotic cells. We have carried out virtual screening process for FtsA against ZINC database, the best hit molecules obtained from the preliminary docking studies were subjected to SYBYL X 2.0 docking. The molecules ZINC74432848, ZINC37769607, and ZINC96896268 displayed the highest C-score value of 4.89, 4.49, and 4.22, respectively. The top ranked molecule ZINC74432848 was observed to form 4 hydrogen bonds with FtsA. The simulation study reveals the greater stability of the FtsA-ZINC74432848 complex. If the in vitro and in vivo study turns out affirmative, then ZINC74432848 could be developed as a potent drug for FtsA."
"Fine structure and dynamics of EB3 binding zones on microtubules in fibroblast cells. End-binding (EB) proteins associate with the growing tips of microtubules (MTs) and modulate their dynamics directly and indirectly, by recruiting essential factors to fine-tune MTs for their many essential roles in cells. Previously EB proteins have been shown to recognize a stabilizing GTP/GDP-Pi cap at the tip of growing MTs, but information about additional EB-binding zones on MTs has been limited. In this work, we studied fluorescence intensity profiles of one of the three mammalian EB-proteins, EB3, fused with red fluorescent protein (RFP). The distribution of EB3 on MTs in mouse fibroblasts frequently deviated from single exponential decay and exhibited secondary peaks. Those secondary peaks, which we refer to as EB3-islands, were detected on 56% comets of growing MTs and were encountered once per 44 s of EB3-RFP comet growth time with about 5 s half-lifetime. The majority of EB3-islands in the vicinity of MT tips was stationary and originated from EB3 comets moving with the growing MT tips. Computational modeling of the decoration of dynamic MT tips by EB3 suggested that the EB3-islands could not be explained simply by a stochastic first-order GTP hydrolysis/phosphate release. We speculate that additional protein factors contribute to EB3 residence time on MTs in cells, likely affecting MT dynamics."
"Medical education trends for future physicians in the era of advanced technology and artificial intelligence: an integrative review. BACKGROUND: Medical education must adapt to different health care contexts, including digitalized health care systems and a digital generation of students in a hyper-connected world. The aims of this study are to identify and synthesize the values that medical educators need to implement in the curricula and to introduce representative educational programs. METHODS: An integrative review was conducted to combine data from various research designs. We searched for articles on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO ERIC between 2011 and 2017. Key search terms were ""undergraduate medical education,"" ""future,"" ""twenty-first century,"" ""millennium,"" ""curriculum,"" ""teaching,"" ""learning,"" and ""assessment."" We screened and extracted them according to inclusion and exclusion criteria from titles and abstracts. All authors read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes and subthemes. Data appraisal was performed using a modified Hawker 's evaluation form. RESULTS: Among the 7616 abstracts initially identified, 28 full-text articles were selected to reflect medical education trends and suggest suitable educational programs. The integrative themes and subthemes of future medical education are as follows: 1) a humanistic approach to patient safety that involves encouraging humanistic doctors and facilitating collaboration; 2) early experience and longitudinal integration by early exposure to patient-oriented integration and longitudinal integrated clerkships; 3) going beyond hospitals toward society by responding to changing community needs and showing respect for diversity; and 4) student-driven learning with advanced technology through active learning with individualization, social interaction, and resource accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This review integrated the trends in undergraduate medical education in readiness for the anticipated changes in medical environments. The detailed programs introduced in this study could be useful for medical educators in the development of curricula. Further research is required to integrate the educational trends into graduate and continuing medical education, and to investigate the status or effects of innovative educational programs in each medical school or environment."
"A graph-based lesion characterization and deep embedding approach for improved computer-aided diagnosis of nonmass breast MRI lesions. Nonmass-like enhancements are a common but diagnostically challenging finding in breast MRI. Nonmass-like lesions can be described as clusters of spatially and temporally inter-connected regions of enhancements, so they can be modeled as networks and their properties characterized via network-based connectivity. In this work, we represented nonmass lesions as graphs using a link formation energy model that favors linkages between regions of similar enhancement and closer spatial proximity. However, adding graph features to an existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) pipeline incurs an increase of feature space dimensionality, which poses additional challenges to traditional supervised machine learning techniques due to the inability to increase accordingly the number of training datasets. We propose the combination of unsupervised dimensionality reduction and embedded space clustering followed by a supervised classifier to improve the performance of a CAD system for nonmass-like lesions in breast MRI. Our work extends a previoulsy proposed framework for deep embedded unsupervised clustering (DEC) to embedding space classification, with the joint optimization of objective functions for DEC and supervised multi-layered perceptron (MLP) classification. The strength of the method lies in the ability to learn and further optimize an embedded feature representation of lower dimensionality that maximizes the diagnostic accuracy of a CAD lesion classifier to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. We identified 792 nonmass-like enhancements (267 benign, 110 malignant and 415 unknown) in 411 patients undergoing breast MRI at our institution. The diagnostic performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared to the performance of a conventional supervised MLP classifier in original feature space. A statistically significant increase in diagnostic area under the ROC curve (AUC) was achieved. Generalization AUC increased from 0.67+/-0.08 to 0.81+/-0.10 (21% increase, p-value=4.2x10(-8)) with the proposed graph-based lesion characterization and deep embedding framework."
"Assessment of Machine Learning Detection of Environmental Enteropathy and Celiac Disease in Children. Importance: Duodenal biopsies from children with enteropathies associated with undernutrition, such as environmental enteropathy (EE) and celiac disease (CD), display significant histopathological overlap. Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection of pathologic morphological features in diseased vs healthy duodenal tissue. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective diagnostic study, a CNN consisting of 4 convolutions, 1 fully connected layer, and 1 softmax layer was trained on duodenal biopsy images. Data were provided by 3 sites: Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan; University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; and University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Duodenal biopsy slides from 102 children (10 with EE from Aga Khan University Hospital, 16 with EE from University Teaching Hospital, 34 with CD from University of Virginia, and 42 with no disease from University of Virginia) were converted into 3118 images. The CNN was designed and analyzed at the University of Virginia. The data were collected, prepared, and analyzed between November 2017 and February 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Classification accuracy of the CNN per image and per case and incorrect classification rate identified by aggregated 10-fold cross-validation confusion/error matrices of CNN models. Results: Overall, 102 children participated in this study, with a median (interquartile range) age of 31.0 (20.3-75.5) months and a roughly equal sex distribution, with 53 boys (51.9%). The model demonstrated 93.4% case-detection accuracy and had a false-negative rate of 2.4%. Confusion metrics indicated most incorrect classifications were between patients with CD and healthy patients. Feature map activations were visualized and learned distinctive patterns, including microlevel features in duodenal tissues, such as alterations in secretory cell populations. Conclusions and Relevance: A machine learning-based histopathological analysis model demonstrating 93.4% classification accuracy was developed for identifying and differentiating between duodenal biopsies from children with EE and CD. The combination of the CNN with a deconvolutional network enabled feature recognition and highlighted secretory cells' role in the model's ability to differentiate between these histologically similar diseases."
"Radiomic versus Convolutional Neural Networks Analysis for Classification of Contrast-enhancing Lesions at Multiparametric Breast MRI. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of radiomic analysis (RA) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to radiologists for classification of contrast agent-enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Materials and Methods Between August 2011 and August 2015, 447 patients with 1294 enhancing lesions (787 malignant, 507 benign; median size, 15 mm +/- 20) were evaluated. Lesions were manually segmented by one breast radiologist. RA was performed by using L1 regularization and principal component analysis. CNN used a deep residual neural network with 34 layers. All algorithms were also retrained on half the number of lesions (n = 647). Machine interpretations were compared with prospective interpretations by three breast radiologists. Standard of reference was histologic analysis or follow-up. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) were used to compare diagnostic performance. Results CNN trained on the full cohort was superior to training on the half-size cohort (AUC, 0.88 vs 0.83, respectively; P = .01), but there was no difference for RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81 vs 0.80, respectively; P = .76) or RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.78, respectively; P = .93). By using the full cohort, CNN performance (AUC, 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.89) was better than RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81; 95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.83; P < .001) and RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.80; P < .001). However, CNN was inferior to breast radiologist interpretation (AUC, 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 0.99; P < .001). Conclusion A convolutional neural network was superior to radiomic analysis for classification of enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Both approaches were inferior to radiologists' performance; however, more training data will further improve performance of convolutional neural network, but not that of radiomics algorithms.

"Computational aided mechanistic understanding of Camellia sinensis bioactive compounds against co-chaperone p23 as potential anticancer agent. Co-chaperon p23 has been well established as molecular chaperon for the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) that further leads to immorality in cancer cells by providing defense against Hsp90 inhibitors, and as stimulating agent for generating overexpressed antiapoptotic proteins, that is, Hsp70 and Hsp27. The natural compounds such as catechins from Camellia sinensis (green tea) are also well known for inhibition activity against various cancer. However, molecular interaction profile and potential lead bioactive compounds against co-chaperon p23 from green tea are not yet reported. To this context, we study the various secondary metabolites of green tea against co-chaperon p23 using structure-based virtual screening from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) database. Following 26 compounds were obtained from TCM database and further studied for extra precision molecular docking that showed binding score between âˆ’10.221 and âˆ’2.276 kcal/mol with co-chaperon p23. However, relative docking score to known inhibitors, that is, ailanthone (âˆ’4.54 kcal/mol) and gedunin (3.60 kcal/mol) along with ADME profile analysis concluded epicatechin (âˆ’7.013 kcal/mol) and cis-theaspirone (âˆ’4.495 kcal/mol) as potential lead inhibitors from green tea against co-chaperone p23. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation and molecular mechanics generalized born surface area calculations validated that epicatechin and cis-theaspirone have significantly occupied the active region of co-chaperone p23 by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with various residues including most substantial amino acids, that is, Thr90, Ala94, and Lys95. Hence, these results supported the fact that green tea contained potential compounds with an ability to inhibit the cancer by disrupting the co-chaperon p23 activity."
"Functional mimetic peptide discovery isolated by phage display interacts selectively to fibronectin domain and inhibits gelatinase. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play critical roles in a multiple number of autoimmunity diseases progression and metastasis of solid tumor. Gelatinases including MMP-2 and MMP-9 are extremely overexpressed in multiple pathological processes. MMP-9 and MMP-2 breakdown the extracellular matrix component gelatin very efficaciously. Therefore, designing and expansion of MMPs inhibitors can be an engrossing plan for therapeutic intermediacy. Anyway, a wide range of MMPs inhibitors face failure in several clinical trials. Due to sequence and structural conservation across the various MMPs, achieving specific and selective inhibitors is very demanding. In the current study, a phage-displayed peptide library was screened using active human recombinant MMP-9 protein and evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Here, we isolate novel peptide sequence from phage display peptide libraries that can be a specific gelatinase inhibitor. Interestingly, in silico molecular docking showed strong interactions between the peptide three-dimensional models and some important residues of the MMP-9 and MMP-2 proteins at the fibronectin domain. A consensus peptide sequence was then synthesized (named as RSH-12) to evaluate its inhibitory potency by in vitro assays. Zymography assay was employed to evaluate the effect of RSH-12 on gelatinolysis activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion from the HT1080 cells using different concentrations of RSH-12 and inhibiting MMP-9- and MMP-2-driven gelatin proteolysis, measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-gelatin degradation assay and HT1080 cellÂ invasion assay on Matrigel (gelatinous protein mixture). The negative control peptide (CP) with the irrelevant sequence and no MMP inhibition properties and the positive control compound (GM6001) as a potent inhibitor of MMPs were used to assess the selectivity and specificity of gelatinases inhibition by RSH-12. Therefore, RSH-12 decreased the gelatin degradation by specifically preventing gelatin binding to MMP-9 and MMP-2. Selective gelatinase inhibitors may prove the usefulness of the new peptide discovered in tumor targeting and anticancer and anti-inflammation therapies."
"Prior dengue virus infection and risk of Zika: A pediatric cohort in Nicaragua. Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in northeast Brazil in 2015 and spread rapidly across the Americas, in populations that have been largely exposed to dengue virus (DENV). The impact of prior DENV infection on ZIKV infection outcome remains unclear. To study this potential impact, we analyzed the large 2016 Zika epidemic in Managua, Nicaragua, in a pediatric cohort with well-characterized DENV infection histories. Methods and findings: Symptomatic ZIKV infections (Zika cases) were identified by real-time reverse transcription PCR and serology in a community-based cohort study that follows approximately 3,700 children aged 2-14 years old. Annual blood samples were used to identify clinically inapparent ZIKV infections using a novel, well-characterized serological assay. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to examine the relation between prior DENV infection and incidence of symptomatic and inapparent ZIKV infection. The generalized-growth method was used to estimate the effective reproduction number. From January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017, 560 symptomatic ZIKV infections and 1,356 total ZIKV infections (symptomatic and inapparent) were identified, for an overall incidence of 14.0 symptomatic infections (95% CI: 12.9, 15.2) and 36.5 total infections (95% CI: 34.7, 38.6) per 100 person-years. Effective reproduction number estimates ranged from 3.3 to 3.4, depending on the ascending wave period. Incidence of symptomatic and total ZIKV infections was higher in females and older children. Analysis of the effect of prior DENV infection was performed on 3,027 participants with documented DENV infection histories, of which 743 (24.5%) had experienced at least 1 prior DENV infection during cohort follow-up. Prior DENV infection was inversely associated with risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection in the total cohort population (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.81; p < 0.005) and with risk of symptomatic presentation given ZIKV infection (IRR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.86) when adjusted for age, sex, and recent DENV infection (1-2 years before ZIKV infection). Recent DENV infection was significantly associated with decreased risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection when adjusted for age and sex, but not when adjusted for prior DENV infection. Prior or recent DENV infection did not affect the rate of total ZIKV infections. Our findings are limited to a pediatric population and constrained by the epidemiology of the site. Conclusions: These findings support that prior DENV infection may protect individuals from symptomatic Zika. More research is needed to address the possible immunological mechanism(s) of cross-protection between ZIKV and DENV and whether DENV immunity also modulates other ZIKV infection outcomes such as neurological or congenital syndromes."
"The unfolded protein response modulators GSK2606414 and KIRA6 are potent KIT inhibitors. IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 are the three transducers of the mammalian canonical unfolded protein response (UPR). GSK2606414 is a potent inhibitor of PERK, while KIRA6 inhibits the kinase activity of IRE1. Both molecules are frequently used to probe the biological roles of the UPR in mammalian cells. In a direct binding assay, GSK2606414 bound to the cytoplasmic domain of KIT with dissociation constants (Kd) value of 664 Â± 294 nM whereas KIRA6 showed a Kd value of 10.8 Â± 2.9 ÂµM. In silico docking studies confirmed a compact interaction of GSK2606414 and KIRA6 with KIT ATP binding pocket. In cultured cells, GSK2606414 inhibited KIT tyrosine kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations and in a PERK-independent manner. Moreover, in contrast to other KIT inhibitors, GSK2606414 enhanced KIT endocytosis and its lysosomal degradation. Although KIRA6 also inhibited KIT at nanomolar concentrations, it did not prompt KIT degradation, and rescued KIT from GSK2606414-mediated degradation. Consistent with KIT inhibition, nanomolar concentrations of GSK2606414 and KIRA6 were sufficient to induce cell death in a KIT signaling-dependent mast cell leukemia cell line. Our data show for the first time that KIT is a shared target for two seemingly unrelated UPR inhibitors at concentrations that overlap with PERK and IRE1 inhibition. Furthermore, these data underscore discrepancies between in vitro binding measurements of kinase inhibitors and inhibition of the tyrosine kinase receptors in living cells."
"Odanacatib for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis: results of the LOFT multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and LOFT Extension study. Background: Odanacatib, a cathepsin K inhibitor, reduces bone resorption while maintaining bone formation. Previous work has shown that odanacatib increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of odanacatib to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods: The Long-term Odanacatib Fracture Trial (LOFT) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study at 388 outpatient clinics in 40 countries. Eligible participants were women aged at least 65 years who were postmenopausal for 5 years or more, with a femoral neck or total hip bone mineral density T-score between âˆ’2Â·5 and âˆ’4Â·0 if no previous radiographic vertebral fracture, or between âˆ’1Â·5 and âˆ’4Â·0 with a previous vertebral fracture. Women with a previous hip fracture, more than one vertebral fracture, or a T-score of less than âˆ’4Â·0 at the total hip or femoral neck were not eligible unless they were unable or unwilling to use approved osteoporosis treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oral odanacatib (50 mg once per week) or matching placebo. Randomisation was done using an interactive voice recognition system after stratification for previous radiographic vertebral fracture, and treatment was masked to study participants, investigators and their staff, and sponsor personnel. If the study completed before 5 years of double-blind treatment, consenting participants could enrol in a double-blind extension study (LOFT Extension), continuing their original treatment assignment for up to 5 years from randomisation. Primary endpoints were incidence of vertebral fractures as assessed using radiographs collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months, yearly, and at final study visit in participants for whom evaluable radiograph images were available at baseline and at least one other timepoint, and hip and non-vertebral fractures adjudicated as being a result of osteoporosis as assessed by clinical history and radiograph. Safety was assessed in participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The adjudicated cardiovascular safety endpoints were a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter. Individual cardiovascular endpoints and death were also assessed. LOFT and LOFT Extension are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00529373) and the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number 2007-002693-66). Findings: Between Sept 14, 2007, and Nov 17, 2009, we randomly assigned 16 071 evaluable patients to treatment: 8043 to odanacatib and 8028 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 36Â·5 months (IQR 34Â·43â€“40Â·15) 4297 women assigned to odanacatib and 3960 assigned to placebo enrolled in LOFT Extension (total median follow-up 47Â·6 months, IQR 35Â·45â€“60Â·06). In LOFT, cumulative incidence of primary outcomes for odanacatib versus placebo were: radiographic vertebral fractures 3Â·7% (251/6770) versus 7Â·8% (542/6910), hazard ratio (HR) 0Â·46, 95% CI 0Â·40â€“0Â·53; hip fractures 0Â·8% (65/8043) versus 1Â·6% (125/8028), 0Â·53, 0Â·39â€“0Â·71; non-vertebral fractures 5Â·1% (412/8043) versus 6Â·7% (541/8028), 0Â·77, 0Â·68â€“0Â·87; all p<0Â·0001. Combined results from LOFT plus LOFT Extension for cumulative incidence of primary outcomes for odanacatib versus placebo were: radiographic vertebral fractures 4Â·9% (341/6909) versus 9Â·6% (675/7011), HR 0Â·48, 95% CI 0Â·42â€“0Â·55; hip fractures 1Â·1% (86/8043) versus 2Â·0% (162/8028), 0Â·52, 0Â·40â€“0Â·67; non-vertebral fractures 6Â·4% (512/8043) versus 8Â·4% (675/8028), 0Â·74, 0Â·66â€“0Â·83; all p<0Â·0001. In LOFT, the composite cardiovascular endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 273 (3Â·4%) of 8043 patients in the odanacatib group versus 245 (3Â·1%) of 8028 in the placebo group (HR 1Â·12, 95% CI 0Â·95â€“1Â·34; p=0Â·18). New-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter occurred in 112 (1Â·4%) of 8043 patients in the odanacatib group versus 96 (1Â·2% of 8028 in the placebo group (HR 1Â·18, 0Â·90â€“1Â·55; p=0Â·24). Odanacatib was associated with an increased risk of stroke (1Â·7% [136/8043] vs 1Â·3% [104/8028], HR 1Â·32, 1Â·02â€“1Â·70; p=0Â·034), but not myocardial infarction (0Â·7% [60/8043] vs 0Â·9% [74/8028], HR 0Â·82, 0Â·58â€“1Â·15; p=0Â·26). The HR for all-cause mortality was 1Â·13 (5Â·0% [401/8043] vs 4Â·4% [356/8028], 0Â·98â€“1Â·30; p=0Â·10). When data from LOFT Extension were included, the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in significantly more patients in the odanacatib group than in the placebo group (401 [5Â·0%] of 8043 vs 343 [4Â·3%] of 8028, HR 1Â·17, 1Â·02â€“1Â·36; p=0Â·029, as did stroke (2Â·3% [187/8043] vs 1Â·7% [137/8028], HR 1Â·37, 1Â·10â€“1Â·71; p=0Â·0051). Interpretation: Odanacatib reduced the risk of fracture, but was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, specifically stroke, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Based on the overall balance between benefit and risk, the study's sponsor decided that they would no longer pursue development of odanacatib for treatment of osteoporosis.

"RNA splicing analysis in genomic medicine. High-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have led to a rapid increase in the number of sequence variants identified in clinical practice via diagnostic genetic tests. Current bioinformatic analysis pipelines fail to take adequate account of the possible splicing effects of such variants, particularly where variants fall outwith canonical splice site sequences, and consequently the pathogenicity of such variants may often be missed. The regulation of splicing is highly complex and as a result, in silico prediction tools lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for reliable use. Variants of all kinds can be linked to aberrant splicing in disease and the need for correct identification and diagnosis grows ever more crucial as novel splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide therapies start to enter clinical usage. RT-PCR provides a useful targeted assay of the splicing effects of identified variants, while minigene assays, massive parallel reporter assays and animal models can also be used for more detailed study of a particular splicing system, given enough time and resources. However, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in genomic medicine. By utilising data science approaches and machine learning, it may prove possible to finally understand and interpret the 'splicing codeâ€™ and apply this knowledge in human disease diagnostics."
"All over the place: deciphering HRAS signaling from different subcellular compartments. RAS (rat sarcoma virus oncogene homolog) oncogenes regulate fundamental biological processes through an ever-expanding signaling network. Using interaction proteomics, phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, and integration of these datasets with a novel biostatistics approach, we have investigated Harvey-RAS (HRAS) signaling from different subcellular sites. The results reveal highly diversified signaling networks that regulate different aspects of HRAS functions."
"A Deep Neural Network for Predicting and Engineering Alternative Polyadenylation. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major driver of transcriptome diversity in human cells. Here, we use deep learning to predict APA from DNA sequence alone. We trained our model (APARENT, APA REgression NeT) on isoform expression data from over 3 million APA reporters. APARENT's predictions are highly accurate when tasked with inferring APA in synthetic and human 3'UTRs. Visualizing features learned across all network layers reveals that APARENT recognizes sequence motifs known to recruit APA regulators, discovers previously unknown sequence determinants of 3' end processing, and integrates these features into a comprehensive, interpretable, cis-regulatory code. We apply APARENT to forward engineer functional polyadenylation signals with precisely defined cleavage position and isoform usage and validate predictions experimentally. Finally, we use APARENT to quantify the impact of genetic variants on APA. Our approach detects pathogenic variants in a wide range of disease contexts, expanding our understanding of the genetic origins of disease."
"Incidence of neonatal neutropenia and leukopenia after in utero exposure to chemotherapy for maternal cancer. Objective: The main purpose of this article was to report the incidence of neonatal neutropenia or leukopenia after chemotherapy exposure during pregnancy according to the time elapsed between treatment during pregnancy and birth. Background: A single study reports 33% of infants exposed to chemotherapy within the last month of pregnancy are born with neutropenia, which can place the newborn at risk for nosocomial infections. On the basis of this report, chemotherapy is typically stopped by 34 weeks of pregnancy to avoid maternal or neonatal myelosuppression at delivery. Such a pause in treatment may affect maternal health. Determining the true incidence of neutropenia after chemotherapy in relation to the time of this lapse in treatment is important to support this practice. Materials and Methods: Complete blood counts are collected for newborn whose mothers were treated for cancer during pregnancy and enrolled in the Cancer and Pregnancy Registry. Neutropenia was defined as absolute neutrophil count< 1000 mm3 and leukopenia was defined as white blood cells < 5000 cells /Î¼L. Incidence of neutropenia was calculated according to the time elapsed from last chemotherapy treatment until birth. Fisher's exact test is used to determine if neutropenia or leukopenia is related to the time elapsed between chemotherapy during pregnancy and newborn birth. A Bayesian analysis evaluated the occurrence of neutropenia and leukopenia according to the number of days between the initiation of chemotherapy and birth. Results: A total of 135 infants exposed to chemotherapy in utero with a complete blood count collected at birth were identified from the database. Only 7.3% and 2.9% of infants were born with neutropenia or leukopenia, respectively. The highest incidence of newborn neutropenia occurred in infants delivered 22 to 28 days after chemotherapy. Conclusions: The incidence of neutropenia peaks when chemotherapy is given 22 to 28 days before birth, while leukopenia is highest if delivery is < 7 days from chemotherapy."
"Predicting factors for survival of breast cancer patients using machine learning techniques. BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in women worldwide. Many studies have been conducted to predict the survival indicators, however most of these analyses were predominantly performed using basic statistical methods. As an alternative, this study used machine learning techniques to build models for detecting and visualising significant prognostic indicators of breast cancer survival rate. METHODS: A large hospital-based breast cancer dataset retrieved from the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (nâ€‰=â€‰8066) with diagnosis information between 1993 and 2016 was used in this study. The dataset contained 23 predictor variables and one dependent variable, which referred to the survival status of the patients (alive or dead). In determining the significant prognostic factors of breast cancer survival rate, prediction models were built using decision tree, random forest, neural networks, extreme boost, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Next, the dataset was clustered based on the receptor status of breast cancer patients identified via immunohistochemistry to perform advanced modelling using random forest. Subsequently, the important variables were ranked via variable selection methods in random forest. Finally, decision trees were built and validation was performed using survival analysis. RESULTS: In terms of both model accuracy and calibration measure, all algorithms produced close outcomes, with the lowest obtained from decision tree (accuracyâ€‰=â€‰79.8%) and the highest from random forest (accuracyâ€‰=â€‰82.7%). The important variables identified in this study were cancer stage classification, tumour size, number of total axillary lymph nodes removed, number of positive lymph nodes, types of primary treatment, and methods of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Interestingly the various machine learning algorithms used in this study yielded close accuracy hence these methods could be used as alternative predictive tools in the breast cancer survival studies, particularly in the Asian region. The important prognostic factors influencing survival rate of breast cancer identified in this study, which were validated by survival curves, are useful and could be translated into decision support tools in the medical domain."
"Big data and machine learning algorithms for health-care delivery. Analysis of big data by machine learning offers considerable advantages for assimilation and evaluation of large amounts of complex health-care data. However, to effectively use machine learning tools in health care, several limitations must be addressed and key issues considered, such as its clinical implementation and ethics in health-care delivery. Advantages of machine learning include flexibility and scalability compared with traditional biostatistical methods, which makes it deployable for many tasks, such as risk stratification, diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. Another advantage of machine learning algorithms is the ability to analyse diverse data types (eg, demographic data, laboratory findings, imaging data, and doctors' free-text notes) and incorporate them into predictions for disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and appropriate treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of machine learning in health-care delivery also presents unique challenges that require data pre-processing, model training, and refinement of the system with respect to the actual clinical problem. Also crucial are ethical considerations, which include medico-legal implications, doctors' understanding of machine learning tools, and data privacy and security. In this Review, we discuss some of the benefits and challenges of big data and machine learning in health care."
"Selective inhibition of P-gp transporter by goniothalamin derivatives sensitizes resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy. Overexpression of efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, primarily P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is a frequent cause of multidrug resistance in cancer and leads to failure of current chemotherapies. Thus, identification of selective P-gp inhibitors might provide a basis for the development of novel anticancer drug candidates. The natural product goniothalamin and 21 derivatives were characterized regarding their ability to inhibit ABC transporter function. Among the goniothalamins, selective inhibitors of P-gp were discovered. The two most potent inhibitors (R)-3 and (S)-3 displayed the ability to increase intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin, thereby sensitizing P-gp-overexpressing tumor cells to chemotherapy by decreasing doxorubicin IC50 value up to 15-fold. Molecular docking studies indicated these compounds to inhibit P-gp by acting as transporter substrates. In conclusion, our findings revealed a novel role of goniothalamin derivatives in reversing P-gp-mediated chemotherapy resistance."
"Matrix metalloproteinases as target genes for gene regulatory networks driving molecular and cellular pathways related to a multistep pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease. The present study investigated a joint contribution of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) genes to ischemic stroke (IS) development and analyzed interactions between MMP genes and genome-wide associated loci for IS. A total of 1288 unrelated Russians (600 IS patients and 688 healthy individuals) from Central Russia were recruited for the study. Genotyping of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP genes (rs1799750, rs243865, rs3025058, rs11225395, rs17576, rs486055, and rs2276109) and eight genome-wide associated loci for IS were done using Taq-Manâ€“based assays and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry iPLEX platform, respectively. Allele âˆ’ 799T at rs11225395 of the MMP8 gene was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IS after adjustment for sex and age (OR = 0.82; 95%CI, 0.70-0.96; P = 0.016). The model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction method has revealed 21 two-order, 124 three-order, and 474 four-order gene-gene (GÃ—G) interactions models meaningfully (Pperm < 0.05) associated with the IS risk. The bioinformatic analysis enabled establishing the studied MMP gene polymorphisms possess a clear regulatory potential and may be targeted by gene regulatory networks driving molecular and cellular pathways related to the pathogenesis of IS. In conclusion, the present study was the first to identify an association between polymorphism rs11225395 of the MMP8 gene and IS risk. The study findings also indicate that MMPs deserve special attention as a potential class of genes influencing the multistep mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease including atherosclerosis in cerebral arteries, acute cerebral artery occlusion as well as the ischemic injury of the brain and its recovery."
"Breath hold effect on cardiovascular brain pulsations â€“ A multimodal magnetic resonance encephalography study. Ultra-fast functional magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG) enables separate assessment of cardiovascular, respiratory, and vasomotor waves from brain pulsations without temporal aliasing. We examined effects of breath hold- (BH) related changes on cardiovascular brain pulsations using MREG to study the physiological nature of cerebrovascular reactivity. We used alternating 32 s BH and 88 s resting normoventilation (NV) to change brain pulsations during MREG combined with simultaneously measured respiration, continuous non-invasive blood pressure, and cortical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in healthy volunteers. Changes in classical resting-state network BOLD-like signal and cortical blood oxygenation were reproduced based on MREG and NIRS signals. Cardiovascular pulsation amplitudes of MREG signal from anterior cerebral artery, oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in frontal cortex, and blood pressure decreased after BH. MREG cardiovascular pulse amplitudes in cortical areas and sagittal sinus increased, while cerebrospinal fluid and white matter remained unchanged. Respiratory centers in the brainstem â€“ hypothalamus â€“ thalamus â€“ amygdala network showed strongest increases in cardiovascular pulsation amplitude. The spatial propagation of averaged cardiovascular impulses altered as a function of successive BH runs. The spread of cardiovascular pulse cycles exhibited a decreasing spatial similarity over time. MREG portrayed spatiotemporally accurate respiratory network activity and cardiovascular pulsation dynamics related to BH challenges at an unpreceded high temporal resolution."
"Identification of long non-coding RNA-related and -coexpressed mRNA biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma. Background: While changes in mRNA expression during tumorigenesis have been used widely as molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis of a number of cancers, the approach has limitations. For example, traditional methods do not consider the regulatory and positional relationship between mRNA and lncRNA. The latter has been largely shown to possess tumor suppressive or oncogenic properties. The combined analysis of mRNA and lncRNA is likely to facilitate the identification of biomarkers with higher confidence. Results: Therefore, we have developed an lncRNA-related method to identify traditional mRNA biomarkers. First we identified mRNAs that are differentially expressed in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) by comparing cancer and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Then, we performed mRNA-lncRNA relationship and coexpression analysis and obtained 41 lncRNA-related and -coexpressed mRNA biomarkers. Next, we performed network analysis, gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis to unravel the functional roles and molecular mechanisms of these lncRNA-related and -coexpressed mRNA biomarkers. Finally, we validated the prediction and performance of the 41 lncRNA-related and -coexpressed mRNA biomarkers using Support Vector Machine model with five-fold cross-validation in an independent HCC dataset from RNA-seq. Conclusions: Our results suggested that mRNAs expression profiles coexpressed with positionally related lncRNAs can provide important insights into early diagnosis and specific targeted gene therapy of HCC."
"Machine Learning Identification of Surgical and Operative Factors Associated with Surgical Expertise in Virtual Reality Simulation. Importance: Despite advances in the assessment of technical skills in surgery, a clear understanding of the composites of technical expertise is lacking. Surgical simulation allows for the quantitation of psychomotor skills, generating data sets that can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Objective: To identify surgical and operative factors selected by a machine learning algorithm to accurately classify participants by level of expertise in a virtual reality surgical procedure. Design, Setting, and Participants: Fifty participants from a single university were recruited between March 1, 2015, and May 31, 2016, to participate in a case series study at McGill University Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre. Data were collected at a single time point and no follow-up data were collected. Individuals were classified a priori as expert (neurosurgery staff), seniors (neurosurgical fellows and senior residents), juniors (neurosurgical junior residents), and medical students, all of whom participated in 250 simulated tumor resections. Exposures: All individuals participated in a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection scenario. Each scenario was repeated 5 times. Main Outcomes and Measures: Through an iterative process, performance metrics associated with instrument movement and force, resection of tissues, and bleeding generated from the raw simulator data output were selected by K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, discriminant analysis, and support vector machine algorithms to most accurately determine group membership. Results: A total of 50 individuals (9 women and 41 men; mean [SD] age, 33.6 [9.5] years; 14 neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 senior residents, 10 junior residents, and 12 medical students) participated. Neurosurgeons were in practice between 1 and 25 years, with 9 (64%) involving a predominantly cranial practice. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm had an accuracy of 90% (45 of 50), the naive Bayes algorithm had an accuracy of 84% (42 of 50), the discriminant analysis algorithm had an accuracy of 78% (39 of 50), and the support vector machine algorithm had an accuracy of 76% (38 of 50). The K-nearest neighbor algorithm used 6 performance metrics to classify participants, the naive Bayes algorithm used 9 performance metrics, the discriminant analysis algorithm used 8 performance metrics, and the support vector machine algorithm used 8 performance metrics. Two neurosurgeons, 1 fellow or senior resident, 1 junior resident, and 1 medical student were misclassified. Conclusions and Relevance: In a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection study, a machine learning algorithm successfully classified participants into 4 levels of expertise with 90% accuracy. These findings suggest that algorithms may be capable of classifying surgical expertise with greater granularity and precision than has been previously demonstrated in surgery.."
"The molecular landscape of glioma in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor predisposition syndrome in which glioma is one of the prevalent tumors. Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifespan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade. High-grade tumors harbored genetic alterations of TP53 and CDKN2A, frequent mutations of ATRX associated with Alternative Lengthening of Telomere, and were enriched in genetic alterations of transcription/chromatin regulation and PI3 kinase pathways. Low-grade tumors exhibited fewer mutations that were over-represented in genes of the MAP kinase pathway. Approximately 50% of low-grade NF1-gliomas displayed an immune signature, T lymphocyte infiltrates, and increased neo-antigen load. DNA methylation assigned NF1-glioma to LGm6, a poorly defined Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 wild-type subgroup enriched with ATRX mutations. Thus, the profiling of NF1-glioma defined a distinct landscape that recapitulates a subset of sporadic tumors."
"Three-dimensional spatially resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue reveal new aspects of NAFLD progression. Early disease diagnosis is key to the effective treatment of diseases. Histopathological analysis of human biopsies is the gold standard to diagnose tissue alterations. However, this approach has low resolution and overlooks 3D (three-dimensional) structural changes resulting from functional alterations. Here, we applied multiphoton imaging, 3D digital reconstructions and computational simulations to generate spatially resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue at different stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We identified a set of morphometric cellular and tissue parameters correlated with disease progression, and discover profound topological defects in the 3D bile canalicular (BC) network. Personalized biliary fluid dynamic simulations predicted an increased pericentral biliary pressure and micro-cholestasis, consistent with elevated cholestatic biomarkers in patientsâ€™ sera. Our spatially resolved models of human liver tissue can contribute to high-definition medicine by identifying quantitative multiparametric cellular and tissue signatures to define disease progression and provide new insights into NAFLD pathophysiology."
"Predict drug sensitivity of cancer cells with pathway activity inference. Background: Predicting cellular responses to drugs has been a major challenge for personalized drug therapy regimen. Recent pharmacogenomic studies measured the sensitivities of heterogeneous cell lines to numerous drugs, and provided valuable data resources to develop and validate computational approaches for the prediction of drug responses. Most of current approaches predict drug sensitivity by building prediction models with individual genes, which suffer from low reproducibility due to biologic variability and difficulty to interpret biological relevance of novel gene-drug associations. As an alternative, pathway activity scores derived from gene expression could predict drug response of cancer cells. Method: In this study, pathway-based prediction models were built with four approaches inferring pathway activity in unsupervised manner, including competitive scoring approaches (DiffRank and GSVA) and self-contained scoring approaches (PLAGE and Z-score). These unsupervised pathway activity inference approaches were applied to predict drug responses of cancer cells using data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Results: Our analysis on all the 24 drugs from CCLE demonstrated that pathway-based models achieved better predictions for 14 out of the 24 drugs, while taking fewer features as inputs. Further investigation on indicated that pathway-based models indeed captured pathways involving drug-related genes (targets, transporters and metabolic enzymes) for majority of drugs, whereas gene-models failed to identify these drug-related genes, in most cases. Among the four approaches, competitive scoring (DiffRank and GSVA) provided more accurate predictions and captured more pathways involving drug-related genes than self-contained scoring (PLAGE and Z-Score). Detailed interpretation of top pathways from the top method (DiffRank) highlights the merit of pathway-based approaches to predict drug response by identifying pathways relevant to drug mechanisms. Conclusion: Taken together, pathway-based modeling with inferred pathway activity is a promising alternative to predict drug response, with the ability to easily interpret results and provide biological insights into the mechanisms of drug actions."
"Structural bioinformatics insights into ATP binding mechanism in zebrafish (Danio rerio) cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (zCDKL5) protein. In mammalian systems, the conserved cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) control the process of cell division and curb the transcription mechanism in response to diverse signaling events that are essential for the catalytic activity. In zebrafish, zCDKL5 portrays differential expression profiling in several tissues and presumed to play a vital role in the neuronal development. In this present study, the sequence-structure relationship and mode of ATP binding in zCDKL5 was unveiled through theoretical modeling, molecular docking, and MD simulations. Like human CDKs, the modeled zCDKL5 was found to be bipartite in nature, where, ATP binds to the central cavity of the catalytic domain through a strong network of H-bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. MD simulation portrayed that conserved residues, viz, Ile10, Gly11, Glu12, Val18, Val64, Glu81, Cys143, and Asp144 were indispensable for tight anchoring of ATP and contribute to the stability of the zCDKL5-ATP complex. MM/PBSA binding free energy analysis displayed that van der Waal energy (Î”G vwd) and Electrostatic energy (Î”G ele) were the major contributors towards the overall binding free energy. Thus, the comparative structural bioinformatics approach has shed new insights into the dynamics and ATP binding mechanism of zCDKL5. The results from the study will help to undertake further research on the role of phosphorylated CDKL5 in the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in higher eukaryotic systems."
"A parsimonious 3-gene signature predicts clinical outcomes in an acute myeloid leukemia multicohort study. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous hematological malignancy with variable responses to chemotherapy. Although recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations are important predictors of outcome, 50% to 70% of AMLs harbor normal or risk-indeterminate karyotypes. Therefore, identifying more effective biomarkers predictive of treatment success and failure is essential for informing tailored therapeutic decisions. We applied an artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning approach to a publicly available data set for a discovery cohort of 593 adults with nonpromyelocytic AML. ANN analysis identified a parsimonious 3-gene expression signature comprising CALCRL, CD109, and LSP1, which was predictive of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). We computed a prognostic index (PI) using normalized gene-expression levels and b-values from subsequently created Cox proportional hazards models, coupled with clinically established prognosticators. Our 3-gene PI separated the adult patients in each European LeukemiaNet cytogenetic risk category into subgroups with different survival probabilities and identified patients with very high-risk features, such as those with a high PI and either FLT3 internal tandem duplication or nonmutated nucleophosmin 1. The PI remained significantly associated with poor EFS and OS after adjusting for established prognosticators, and its ability to stratify survival was validated in 3 independent adult cohorts (n = 905 subjects) and 1 cohort of childhood AML (n = 145 subjects). Further in silico analyses established that AML was the only tumor type among 39 distinct malignancies for which the concomitant upregulation of CALCRL, CD109, and LSP1 predicted survival. Therefore, our ANN-derived 3-gene signature refines the accuracy of patient stratification and the potential to significantly improve outcome prediction."
"A robust fuzzy rule based integrative feature selection strategy for gene expression data in TCGA. Background: Lots of researches have been conducted in the selection of gene signatures that could distinguish the cancer patients from the normal. However, it is still an open question on how to extract the robust gene features. Methods: In this work, a gene signature selection strategy for TCGA data was proposed by integrating the gene expression data, the methylation data and the prior knowledge about cancer biomarkers. Different from the traditional integration method, the expanded 450 K methylation data were applied instead of the original 450 K array data, and the reported biomarkers were weighted in the feature selection. Fuzzy rule based classification method and cross validation strategy were applied in the model construction for performance evaluation. Results: Our selected gene features showed prediction accuracy close to 100% in the cross validation with fuzzy rule based classification model on 6 cancers from TCGA. The cross validation performance of our proposed model is similar to other integrative models or RNA-seq only model, while the prediction performance on independent data is obviously better than other 5 models. The gene signatures extracted with our fuzzy rule based integrative feature selection strategy were more robust, and had the potential to get better prediction results. Conclusion: The results indicated that the integration of expanded methylation data would cover more genes, and had greater capacity to retrieve the signature genes compared with the original 450 K methylation data. Also, the integration of the reported biomarkers was a promising way to improve the performance. PTCHD3 gene was selected as a discriminating gene in 3 out of the 6 cancers, which suggested that it might play important role in the cancer risk and would be worthy for the intensive investigation."
"ClearF: A supervised feature scoring method to find biomarkers using class-wise embedding and reconstruction. Background: Feature selection or scoring methods for the detection of biomarkers are essential in bioinformatics. Various feature selection methods have been developed for the detection of biomarkers, and several studies have employed information-theoretic approaches. However, most of these methods generally require a long processing time. In addition, information-theoretic methods discretize continuous features, which is a drawback that can lead to the loss of information. Results: In this paper, a novel supervised feature scoring method named ClearF is proposed. The proposed method is suitable for continuous-valued data, which is similar to the principle of feature selection using mutual information, with the added advantage of a reduced computation time. The proposed score calculation is motivated by the association between the reconstruction error and the information-theoretic measurement. Our method is based on class-wise low-dimensional embedding and the resulting reconstruction error. Given multi-class datasets such as a case-control study dataset, low-dimensional embedding is first applied to each class to obtain a compressed representation of the class, and also for the entire dataset. Reconstruction is then performed to calculate the error of each feature and the final score for each feature is defined in terms of the reconstruction errors. The correlation between the information theoretic measurement and the proposed method is demonstrated using a simulation. For performance validation, we compared the classification performance of the proposed method with those of various algorithms on benchmark datasets. Conclusions: The proposed method showed higher accuracy and lower execution time than the other established methods. Moreover, an experiment was conducted on the TCGA breast cancer dataset, and it was confirmed that the genes with the highest scores were highly associated with subtypes of breast cancer."
"Coronary artery centerline extraction in cardiac CT angiography using a CNN-based orientation classifier. Coronary artery centerline extraction in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) images is a prerequisite for evaluation of stenoses and atherosclerotic plaque. In this work, we propose an algorithm that extracts coronary artery centerlines in CCTA using a convolutional neural network (CNN). In the proposed method, a 3D dilated CNN is trained to predict the most likely direction and radius of an artery at any given point in a CCTA image based on a local image patch. Starting from a single seed point placed manually or automatically anywhere in a coronary artery, a tracker follows the vessel centerline in two directions using the predictions of the CNN. Tracking is terminated when no direction can be identified with high certainty. The CNN is trained using manually annotated centerlines in training images. No image preprocessing is required, so that the process is guided solely by the local image values around the tracker's location. The CNN was trained using a training set consisting of 8 CCTA images with a total of 32 manually annotated centerlines provided in the MICCAI 2008 Coronary Artery Tracking Challenge (CAT08). Evaluation was performed within the CAT08 challenge using a test set consisting of 24 CCTA test images in which 96 centerlines were extracted. The extracted centerlines had an average overlap of 93.7% with manually annotated reference centerlines. Extracted centerline points were highly accurate, with an average distance of 0.21mm to reference centerline points. Based on these results the method ranks third among 25 publicly evaluated methods in CAT08. In a second test set consisting of 50 CCTA scans acquired at our institution (UMCU), an expert placed 5448 markers in the coronary arteries, along with radius measurements. Each marker was used as a seed point to extract a single centerline, which was compared to the other markers placed by the expert. This showed strong correspondence between extracted centerlines and manually placed markers. In a third test set containing 36 CCTA scans from the MICCAI 2014 Challenge on Automatic Coronary Calcium Scoring (orCaScore), fully automatic seeding and centerline extraction was evaluated using a segment-wise analysis. This showed that the algorithm is able to fully-automatically extract on average 92% of clinically relevant coronary artery segments. Finally, the limits of agreement between reference and automatic artery radius measurements were found to be below the size of one voxel in both the CAT08 dataset and the UMCU dataset. Extraction of a centerline based on a single seed point required on average 0.4+/-0.1 s and fully automatic coronary tree extraction required around 20 s. The proposed method is able to accurately and efficiently determine the direction and radius of coronary arteries based on information derived directly from the image data. The method can be trained with limited training data, and once trained allows fast automatic or interactive extraction of coronary artery trees from CCTA images."
"Matrine attenuates high-fat diet-induced in vivo and ox-LDL-induced in vitro vascular injury by regulating the PKCÎ±/eNOS and PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathways. Lipid metabolism disorders lead to vascular endothelial injury. Matrine is an alkaloid that has been used to improve obesity and diabetes and for the treatment of hepatitis B. However, its effect on lipid metabolism disorders and vascular injury is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of matrine on high-fat diet fed mice and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Computational virtual docking analyses, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C-Î± (PKCÎ±) inhibitors were used to localize matrine in vascular injuries. The results showed that matrine-treated mice were more resistant to abnormal lipid metabolism and inflammation than vehicle-treated mice and exhibited significantly alleviated ox-LDL-stimulated dysfunction of HUVECs, restored diminished nitric oxide release, decreased reactive oxygen species generation and increased expression phosphorylation of AKT-Ser473 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-Ser1177. Matrine not only up-regulates eNOS-Ser1177 but also down-regulates eNOS-Thr495, a PKCÎ±-controlled negative regulator of eNOS. Using computational virtual docking analyses and biochemical assays, matrine was also shown to influence eNOS/NO via PKCÎ± inhibition. Moreover, the protective effects of matrine were significantly abolished by the simultaneous application of PKCÎ± and the PI3K inhibitor. Matrine may thus be potentially employed as a novel therapeutic strategy against high-fat diet-induced vascular injury."
"Gastroenterologist-Level Identification of Small-Bowel Diseases and Normal Variants by Capsule Endoscopy Using a Deep-Learning Model. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized investigation of the small bowel. However, this technique produces a video that is 8-10 hours long, so analysis is time consuming for gastroenterologists. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can recognize specific images among a large variety. We aimed to develop a CNN-based algorithm to assist in the evaluation of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SB-CE) images. METHODS: We collected 113,426,569 images from 6970 patients who had SB-CE at 77 medical centers from July 2016 through July 2018. A CNN-based auxiliary reading model was trained to differentiate abnormal from normal images using 158,235 SB-CE images from 1970 patients. Images were categorized as normal, inflammation, ulcer, polyps, lymphangiectasia, bleeding, vascular disease, protruding lesion, lymphatic follicular hyperplasia, diverticulum, parasite, and other. The model was further validated in 5000 patients (no patient was overlap with the 1970 patients in the training set); the same patients were evaluated by conventional analysis and CNN-based auxiliary analysis by 20 gastroenterologists. If there was agreement in image categorization between the conventional analysis and CNN model, no further evaluation was performed. If there was disagreement between the conventional analysis and CNN model, the gastroenterologists re-evaluated the image to confirm or reject the CNN categorization. RESULTS: In the SB-CE images from the validation set, 4206 abnormalities in 3280 patients were identified after final consensus evaluation. The CNN-based auxiliary model identified abnormalities with 99.88% sensitivity in the per-patient analysis (95% CI, 99.67-99.96) and 99.90% sensitivity in the per-lesion analysis (95% CI, 99.74-99.97). Conventional reading by the gastroenterologists identified abnormalities with 74.57% sensitivity (95% CI, 73.05-76.03) in the per-patient analysis and 76.89% in the per-lesion analysis (95% CI, 75.58-78.15). The mean reading time per patient was 96.6 +/- 22.53 minutes by conventional reading and 5.9 +/- 2.23 minutes by CNN-based auxiliary reading (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We validated the ability of a CNN-based algorithm to identify abnormalities in SB-CE images. The CNN-based auxiliary model identified abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity and significantly shorter reading times than conventional analysis by gastroenterologists. This algorithm provides an important tool to help gastroenterologists analyze SB-CE images more efficiently and more accurately."
"Automated segmentation of knee bone and cartilage combining statistical shape knowledge and convolutional neural networks: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. We present a method for the automated segmentation of knee bones and cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that combines a priori knowledge of anatomical shape with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed approach incorporates 3D Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) as well as 2D and 3D CNNs to achieve a robust and accurate segmentation of even highly pathological knee structures. The shape models and neural networks employed are trained using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and the MICCAI grand challenge ""Segmentation of Knee Images 2010"" (SKI10), respectively. We evaluate our method on 40 validation and 50 submission datasets from the SKI10 challenge. For the first time, an accuracy equivalent to the inter-observer variability of human readers is achieved in this challenge. Moreover, the quality of the proposed method is thoroughly assessed using various measures for data from the OAI, i.e. 507 manual segmentations of bone and cartilage, and 88 additional manual segmentations of cartilage. Our method yields sub-voxel accuracy for both OAI datasets. We make the 507 manual segmentations as well as our experimental setup publicly available to further aid research in the field of medical image segmentation. In conclusion, combining localized classification via CNNs with statistical anatomical knowledge via SSMs results in a state-of-the-art segmentation method for knee bones and cartilage from MRI data."
"Genetic algorithm as an optimization tool for the development of sponge cell culture media. Sponges are rich sources of novel natural products. Production in cell cultures may be an option for supply of these compounds but there are currently no sponge cell lines. Because there is a lack of understanding about the precise conditions and nutritional requirements that are necessary to sustain sponge cells in vitro, there has yet to be a defined, sponge-specific nutrient medium. This study utilized a genetic algorithm approach to optimize the amino acid composition of a commercially available basal cell culture medium in order to increase the metabolic activity of cells of the marine sponge Dysidea etheria. Four generations of the algorithm were carried out in vitro in wet lab conditions and an optimal medium combination was selected for further evaluation. When compared to the basal medium control, there was a twofold increase in metabolic activity. The genetic algorithm approach can be used to optimize other components of culture media to efficiently optimize chosen parameters without the need for detailed knowledge on all possible interactions."
"Development of Chinese gastric cancer surgery: Opportunities and challenges. With the approaches of artificial intelligence and big data, the development of cancer genomics and updating of imaging technology, gastric cancer surgery is facing great challenges and opportunities. The main focus is on laparoscopic surgery technology, enhanced recovery after surgery, multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment, and precision medicine. Considering the common demand for reduced complication rate among doctors and patients, laparoscopic surgery has become widely popular owing to its advantages of small incision and rapid recovery. Furthermore, the development of artificial intelligence and big data has raised a new challenge in routine diagnosis and treatment. As a result, we encourage multicenter cooperation, and data standardization and sharing. At present, completion of the transition from empirical medicine to evidence-based medicine and promotion of the individualization and standardization of gastric cancer treatment are needed."
"Organ preservation in bladder cancer: an opportunity for truly personalized treatment. Radical treatment of many solid tumours has moved from surgery to multimodal organ preservation strategies combining systemic and local treatments. Trimodality bladder-preserving treatment (TMT) comprises maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumour followed by radiotherapy and concurrent radiosensitizing treatment, thereby sparing the urinary bladder. From the patient's perspective, the choice of maintaining quality of life without a negative effect on the chances of cure and long-term survival is attractive. In muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the evidence shows comparable clinical outcomes between patients undergoing radical cystectomy and TMT. Despite this evidence, many patients continue to be offered radical surgery as the standard-of-care treatment. Improvements in radiotherapy techniques with adaptive radiotherapy and advances in imaging translate to increases in the accuracy of treatment delivery and reductions in long-term toxicities. With the advent of novel biomarkers promising improved prediction of treatment response, stratification of patients for different treatments on the basis of tumour biology could soon be a reality. The future of oncological treatment lies in personalized medicine with the combination of technological and biological advances leading to truly bespoke management for patients with MIBC."
"Reversal effect of FW-04-806, a macrolide dilactone compound, on multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro and in vivo. Background: Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, has been proved to be a major trigger for multidrug resistance (MDR) in certain types of cancer. A promising approach to reverse MDR is the combined use of nontoxic and potent ABC transporters inhibitor with conventional anticancer drugs. We previously reported that FW-04-806 (conglobatin) as a novel Hsp90 inhibitor with low toxicity, capable of attenuating Hsp90/Cdc37 /clients interactions and producing antitumor action in vitro and in vivo. Our early activity screening found that FW-04-806 at non-cytotoxic concentration was able to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents on the ABCB1 overexpressing cells. Therefore, we speculated that FW-04-806 might be a promising MDR reversal agent. In the present study we further investigated its reversal effect of MDR induced by ABC transporters in vitro and in vivo. Methods: MTT assay in vitro and xenograftes in vivo were used to investigate reversal effect of FW-04-806 on MDR in ABCB1 or ABCG2 overexpressing cancer cells. To understand the mechanisms for the MDR reversal, we examined the effects of FW-04-806 on intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX, adriamycin, adr)/Rhodamine 123 (Rho 123), efflux of doxorubicin, expression levels of gene and protein of ABCB1 or ABCG2 and ATPase activity of ABCB1, and carried out molecular docking between FW-04-806 and human ABCB1. Results: The results indicated that FW-04-806 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of substrate chemotherapeutic agents on the ABCB1 or ABCG2 overexpressing cells in vitro and in vivo suggesting its reversal MDR effects. FW-04-806 increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX or Rho123 by inhibiting the efflux function of ABC transporters in MDR cells rather than in their parental sensitive cells. However, unlike other ABC transporter inhibitors, FW-04-806 had no effect on the ATPase activity nor on the expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 on either mRNA or protein level. Molecular docking suggested that FW-04-806 may have lower affinity to the ATPase site, which was consistent with its no significant effect on the ATPase activity of ABCB1; However FW-04-806 may bind to substrate binding site in TMDs more stably than substrate anticancer drugs therefore obstruct the anticancer drugs pumped out of the cell. Conclusions: FW-04-806 is a compound that has both anti-tumor and reversal MDR effects, and its antitumor clinical application is worth further study.

"The Inhibitory Effect of GlmU Acetyltransferase Inhibitor TPSA on Mycobacterium tuberculosis May Be Affected Due to Its Methylation by Methyltransferase Rv0560c. Mycobacterium tuberculosis bifunctional enzyme GlmU is a novel target for anti-TB drugs and is involved in glycosyl donor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis. Here, we found that TPSA (2-[5-(2-{[4-(2-thienyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]sulfanyl}acetyl)-2-thienyl]acetic acid) was a novel inhibitor for GlmU acetyltransferase activity (IC50: 5.3 Î¼M). The interaction sites of GlmU and TPSA by molecular docking were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. TPSA showed an inhibitory effect on Mtb H37Ra growth and intracellular H37Ra in macrophage cells (MIC: 66.5 Î¼M). To investigate why TPSA at a higher concentration (66.5 Î¼M) was able to inhibit H37Ra growth, proteome and transcriptome of H37Ra treated with TPSA were analyzed. The expression of two methyltransferases MRA_0565 (Rv0558) and MRA_0567 (Rv0560c) were markedly increased. TPSA was pre-incubated with purified Rv0558 and Rv0560c in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (methyl donor) respectively, resulting in its decreased inhibitory effect of GlmU on acetyltransferase activity. The inhibition of TPSA on growth of H37Ra with overexpressed Rv0558 and Rv0560c was reduced. These implied that methyltransferases could modify TPSA. The methylation of TPSA catalyzed by Rv0560c was subsequently confirmed by LC-MS. Therefore, TPSA as a GlmU acetyltransferase activity inhibitor may offer a structural basis for new anti-tuberculosis drugs. TPSA needs to be modified further by some groups to prevent its methylation by methyltransferases."
"Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Myocardial Infarction in the Absence of Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. Myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease is found in approximately 5% to 6% of all patients with acute infarction who are referred for coronary angiography. There are a variety of causes that can result in this clinical condition. As such, it is important that patients are appropriately diagnosed and an evaluation to uncover the correct cause is performed so that, when possible, specific therapies to treat the underlying cause can be prescribed. This statement provides a formal and updated definition for the broadly labelled term MINOCA (incorporating the definition of acute myocardial infarction from the newly released ""Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction"") and provides a clinically useful framework and algorithms for the diagnostic evaluation and management of patients with myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease."
"Latent Dirichlet Allocation in predicting clinical trial terminations. BACKGROUND: This study used natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify reliable patterns from within research narrative documents to distinguish studies that complete successfully, from the ones that terminate. Recent research findings have reported that at least 10 % of all studies that are funded by major research funding agencies terminate without yielding useful results. Since it is well-known that scientific studies that receive funding from major funding agencies are carefully planned, and rigorously vetted through the peer-review process, it was somewhat daunting to us that study-terminations are this prevalent. Moreover, our review of the literature about study terminations suggested that the reasons for study terminations are not well understood. We therefore aimed to address that knowledge gap, by seeking to identify the factors that contribute to study failures. METHOD: We used data from the clinicialTrials.gov repository, from which we extracted both structured data (study characteristics), and unstructured data (the narrative description of the studies). We applied natural language processing techniques to the unstructured data to quantify the risk of termination by identifying distinctive topics that are more frequently associated with trials that are terminated and trials that are completed. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to derive 25 ""topics"" with corresponding sets of probabilities, which we then used to predict study-termination by utilizing random forest modeling. We fit two distinct models - one using only structured data as predictors and another model with both structured data and the 25 text topics derived from the unstructured data. RESULTS: In this paper, we demonstrate the interpretive and predictive value of LDA as it relates to predicting clinical trial failure. The results also demonstrate that the combined modeling approach yields robust predictive probabilities in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, relative to a model that utilizes the structured data alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the use of topic modeling using LDA significantly raises the utility of unstructured data in better predicating the completion vs. termination of studies. This study sets the direction for future research to evaluate the viability of the designs of health studies."
"Differential expression of the TwHMGS gene and its effect on triptolide biosynthesis in Tripterygium wilfordii. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) is the first committed enzyme in the MVA pathway and involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes in Tripterygium wilfordii. The full-length cDNA and a 515 bp RNAi target fragment of TwHMGS were ligated into the pH7WG2D and pK7GWIWG2D vectors to respectively overexpress and silence, TwHMGS was overexpressed and silenced in T. wilfordii suspension cells using biolistic-gun mediated transformation, which resulted in 2-fold increase and a drop to 70% in the expression level compared to cells with empty vector controls. During TwHMGS overexpression, the expression of TwHMGR, TwDXR and TwTPS7v2 was significantly upregulated to the control. In the RNAi group, the expression of TwHMGR, TwDXS, TwDXR and TwMCT visibly displayed downregulation to the control. The cells with TwHMGS overexpressed produced twice higher than the control value. These results proved that differential expression of TwHMGS determined the production of triptolide in T. wilfordii and laterally caused different trends of relative gene expression in the terpene biosynthetic pathway. Finally, the substrate acetyl-CoA was docked into the active site of TwHMGS, suggesting the key residues including His247, Lys256 and Arg296 undergo electrostatic or H-bond interactions with acetyl-CoA."
"Defining HLA-II Ligand Processing and Binding Rules with Mass Spectrometry Enhances Cancer Epitope Prediction. Increasing evidence indicates CD4(+) T cells can recognize cancer-specific antigens and control tumor growth. However, it remains difficult to predict the antigens that will be presented by human leukocyte antigen class II molecules (HLA-II), hindering efforts to optimally target them therapeutically. Obstacles include inaccurate peptide-binding prediction and unsolved complexities of the HLA-II pathway. To address these challenges, we developed an improved technology for discovering HLA-II binding motifs and conducted a comprehensive analysis of tumor ligandomes to learn processing rules relevant in the tumor microenvironment. We profiled >40 HLA-II alleles and showed that binding motifs were highly sensitive to HLA-DM, a peptide-loading chaperone. We also revealed that intratumoral HLA-II presentation was dominated by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) rather than cancer cells. Integrating these observations, we developed algorithms that accurately predicted APC ligandomes, including peptides from phagocytosed cancer cells. These tools and biological insights will enable improved HLA-II-directed cancer therapies."
"Fully convolutional multi-scale residual DenseNets for cardiac segmentation and automated cardiac diagnosis using ensemble of classifiers. Deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based architectures have shown great potential in medical image segmentation. However, such architectures usually have millions of parameters and inadequate number of training samples leading to over-fitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we present a novel DenseNet based FCN architecture for cardiac segmentation which is parameter and memory efficient. We propose a novel up-sampling path which incorporates long skip and short-cut connections to overcome the feature map explosion in conventional FCN based architectures. In order to process the input images at multiple scales and view points simultaneously, we propose to incorporate Inception module's parallel structures. We propose a novel dual loss function whose weighting scheme allows to combine advantages of cross-entropy and Dice loss leading to qualitative improvements in segmentation. We demonstrate computational efficacy of incorporating conventional computer vision techniques for region of interest detection in an end-to-end deep learning based segmentation framework. From the segmentation maps we extract clinically relevant cardiac parameters and hand-craft features which reflect the clinical diagnostic analysis and train an ensemble system for cardiac disease classification. We validate our proposed network architecture on three publicly available datasets, namely: (i) Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC-2017), (ii) Left Ventricular segmentation challenge (LV-2011), (iii) 2015 Kaggle Data Science Bowl cardiac challenge data. Our approach in ACDC-2017 challenge stood second place for segmentation and first place in automated cardiac disease diagnosis tasks with an accuracy of 100% on a limited testing set (n=50). In the LV-2011 challenge our approach attained 0.74 Jaccard index, which is so far the highest published result in fully automated algorithms. In the Kaggle challenge our approach for LV volume gave a Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 0.0127, which would have placed us tenth in the original challenge. Our approach combined both cardiac segmentation and disease diagnosis into a fully automated framework which is computationally efficient and hence has the potential to be incorporated in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for clinical application."
"A comparative study of deep learning architectures on melanoma detection. Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, which significantly reduces the life expectancy. Early detection of melanoma can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with skin cancer. Dermoscopic images acquired by dermoscopic instruments are used in computational analysis for skin cancer detection. However, some image quality limitations such as noises, shadows, artefacts exist that could compromise the robustness of the skin image analysis. Hence, developing an automatic intelligent system for skin cancer diagnosis with accurate detection rate is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in dermoscopic images of skin lesions. Our experiment is conducted on a graphics processing unit (GPU)to speed up the training and deployment process. To enhance the quality of images, we employ different pre-processing steps. We also apply data augmentation methodology such as horizontal and vertical flipping techniques to address the class skewness problem. Both pre-processing and data augmentation could help to improve the final accuracy."
"Advances in protein structure prediction and design. The prediction of protein three-dimensional structure from amino acid sequence has been a grand challenge problem in computational biophysics for decades, owing to its intrinsic scientific interest and also to the many potential applications for robust protein structure prediction algorithms, from genome interpretation to protein function prediction. More recently, the inverse problem - designing an amino acid sequence that will fold into a specified three-dimensional structure - has attracted growing attention as a potential route to the rational engineering of proteins with functions useful in biotechnology and medicine. Methods for the prediction and design of protein structures have advanced dramatically in the past decade. Increases in computing power and the rapid growth in protein sequence and structure databases have fuelled the development of new data-intensive and computationally demanding approaches for structure prediction. New algorithms for designing protein folds and protein-protein interfaces have been used to engineer novel high-order assemblies and to design from scratch fluorescent proteins with novel or enhanced properties, as well as signalling proteins with therapeutic potential. In this Review, we describe current approaches for protein structure prediction and design and highlight a selection of the successful applications they have enabled."
"Co-occurring genomic alterations in non-small-cell lung cancer biology and therapy. The impressive clinical activity of small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for oncogene-addicted subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (for example, those driven by activating mutations in the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or rearrangements in the genes encoding the receptor tyrosine kinases anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) and rearranged during transfection (RET)) has established an oncogene-centric molecular classification paradigm in this disease. However, recent studies have revealed considerable phenotypic diversity downstream of tumour-initiating oncogenes. Co-occurring genomic alterations, particularly in tumour suppressor genes such as TP53 and LKB1 (also known as STK11), have emerged as core determinants of the molecular and clinical heterogeneity of oncogene-driven lung cancer subgroups through their effects on both tumour cell-intrinsic and non-cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks. In this Review, we discuss the impact of co-mutations on the pathogenesis, biology, microenvironmental interactions and therapeutic vulnerabilities of non-small-cell lung cancer and assess the challenges and opportunities that co-mutations present for personalized anticancer therapy, as well as the expanding field of precision immunotherapy."
"Predicting dark respiration rates of wheat leaves from hyperspectral reflectance. Greater availability of leaf dark respiration (Rdark ) data could facilitate breeding efforts to raise crop yield and improve global carbon cycle modelling. However, the availability of Rdark data is limited because it is cumbersome, time consuming, or destructive to measure. We report a non-destructive and high-throughput method of estimating Rdark from leaf hyperspectral reflectance data that was derived from leaf Rdark measured by a destructive high-throughput oxygen consumption technique. We generated a large dataset of leaf Rdark for wheat (1380 samples) from 90 genotypes, multiple growth stages, and growth conditions to generate models for Rdark . Leaf Rdark (per unit leaf area, fresh mass, dry mass or nitrogen, N) varied 7- to 15-fold among individual plants, whereas traits known to scale with Rdark , leaf N, and leaf mass per area (LMA) only varied twofold to fivefold. Our models predicted leaf Rdark , N, and LMA with r2 values of 0.50-0.63, 0.91, and 0.75, respectively, and relative bias of 17-18% for Rdark and 7-12% for N and LMA. Our results suggest that hyperspectral model prediction of wheat leaf Rdark is largely independent of leaf N and LMA. Potential drivers of hyperspectral signatures of Rdark are discussed."
"The implementation of natural language processing to extract index lesions from breast magnetic resonance imaging reports. BACKGROUND: There are often multiple lesions in breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports and radiologists usually focus on describing the index lesion that is most crucial to clinicians in determining the management and prognosis of patients. Natural language processing (NLP) has been used for information extraction from mammography reports. However, few studies have investigated NLP in breast MRI data based on free-form text. The objective of the current study was to assess the validity of our NLP program to accurately extract index lesions and their corresponding imaging features from free-form text of breast MRI reports. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 1633 free-form text reports of breast MRIs from 2014 to 2017. First, the NLP system was used to extract 9 features from all the lesions in the reports according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) descriptors. Second, the index lesion was defined as the lesion with the largest number of imaging features. Third, we extracted the values of each imaging feature and the BI-RADS category from each index lesion. To evaluate the accuracy of our system, 478 reports were manually reviewed by two individuals. The time taken to extract data by NLP was compared with that by reviewers. RESULTS: The NLP system extracted 889 lesions from 478 reports. The mean number of imaging features per lesion was 6.5Â Â±Â 2.1 (range: 3-9; 95% CI: 6.362-6.638). The mean number of imaging features per index lesion was 8.0Â Â±Â 1.1 (range: 5-9; 95% CI: 7.901-8.099). The NLP system demonstrated a recall of 100.0% and a precision of 99.6% for correct identification of the index lesion. The recall and precision of NLP to correctly extract the value of imaging features from the index lesions were 91.0 and 92.6%, respectively. The recall and precision for the correct identification of the BI-RADS categories were 96.6 and 94.8%, respectively. NLP generated the total results in less than 1â€‰s, whereas the manual reviewers averaged 4.47â€‰min and 4.56â€‰min per report. CONCLUSIONS: Our NLP method successfully extracted the index lesion and its corresponding information from free-form text."
"Interpretable deep neural network for cancer survival analysis by integrating genomic and clinical data. Background: Understanding the complex biological mechanisms of cancer patient survival using genomic and clinical data is vital, not only to develop new treatments for patients, but also to improve survival prediction. However, highly nonlinear and high-dimension, low-sample size (HDLSS) data cause computational challenges to applying conventional survival analysis. Results: We propose a novel biologically interpretable pathway-based sparse deep neural network, named Cox-PASNet, which integrates high-dimensional gene expression data and clinical data on a simple neural network architecture for survival analysis. Cox-PASNet is biologically interpretable where nodes in the neural network correspond to biological genes and pathways, while capturing the nonlinear and hierarchical effects of biological pathways associated with cancer patient survival. We also propose a heuristic optimization solution to train Cox-PASNet with HDLSS data. Cox-PASNet was intensively evaluated by comparing the predictive performance of current state-of-the-art methods on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) cancer. In the experiments, Cox-PASNet showed out-performance, compared to the benchmarking methods. Moreover, the neural network architecture of Cox-PASNet was biologically interpreted, and several significant prognostic factors of genes and biological pathways were identified. Conclusions: Cox-PASNet models biological mechanisms in the neural network by incorporating biological pathway databases and sparse coding. The neural network of Cox-PASNet can identify nonlinear and hierarchical associations of genomic and clinical data to cancer patient survival. The open-source code of Cox-PASNet in PyTorch implemented for training, evaluation, and model interpretation is available at: https://github.com/DataX-JieHao/Cox-PASNet."
"A Subset of Type I Conventional Dendritic Cells Controls Cutaneous Bacterial Infections through VEGFalpha-Mediated Recruitment of Neutrophils. Skin conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) exist as two distinct subsets, cDC1s and cDC2s, which maintain the balance of immunity to pathogens and tolerance to self and microbiota. Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor alpha (VEGF-alpha) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM(+)CD59(+)Ly-6D(+) cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation."
"Natural language processing of Reddit data to evaluate dermatology patient experiences and therapeutics. BACKGROUND: There is a lack of research studying patient-generated data on Reddit, one of the world's most popular forums with active users interested in dermatology. Techniques within natural language processing, a field of artificial intelligence, can analyze large amounts of text information and extract insights. OBJECTIVE: To apply natural language processing to Reddit comments about dermatology topics to assess for feasibility and potential for insights and engagement. METHODS: A software pipeline preprocessed Reddit comments from 2005 to 2017 from 7 popular dermatology-related subforums on Reddit, applied latent Dirichlet allocation, and used spectral clustering to establish cohesive themes and the frequency of word representation and grouped terms within these topics. RESULTS: We created a corpus of 176,000 comments and identified trends in patient engagement in spaces such as eczema and acne, among others, with a focus on homeopathic treatments and isotretinoin. LIMITATIONS: Latent Dirichlet allocation is an unsupervised model, meaning there is no ground truth to which the model output can be compared. However, because these forums are anonymous, there seems little incentive for patients to be dishonest. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit data has viability and utility for dermatologic research and engagement with the public, especially for common dermatology topics such as tanning, acne, and psoriasis."
"Potent hERG channel inhibition by sarizotan, an investigative treatment for Rett Syndrome. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder associated with respiratory abnormalities and, in up to ~40% of patients, with prolongation of the cardiac QTc interval. QTc prolongation calls for cautious use of drugs with a propensity to inhibit hERG channels. The STARS trial has been undertaken to investigate the efficacy of sarizotan, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, at correcting RTT respiratory abnormalities. The present study investigated whether sarizotan inhibits hERG potassium channels and prolongs ventricular repolarization. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements were made at 37 Â°C from hERG-expressing HEK293 cells. Docking analysis was conducted using a recent cryo-EM structure of hERG. Sarizotan was a potent inhibitor of hERG current (IhERG; IC50 of 183 nM) and of native ventricular IKr from guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. 100 nM and 1 Î¼M sarizotan prolonged ventricular action potential (AP) duration (APD90) by 14.1 Â± 3.3% (n = 6) and 29.8 Â± 3.1% (n = 5) respectively and promoted AP triangulation. High affinity IhERG inhibition by sarizotan was contingent upon channel gating and intact inactivation. Mutagenesis experiments and docking analysis implicated F557, S624 and Y652 residues in sarizotan binding, with weaker contribution from F656. In conclusion, sarizotan inhibits IKr/IhERG, accessing key binding residues on channel gating. This action and consequent ventricular AP prolongation occur at concentrations relevant to those proposed to treat breathing dysrhythmia in RTT. Sarizotan should only be used in RTT patients with careful evaluation of risk factors for QTc prolongation."
"An in silico pharmacological approach toward the discovery of potent inhibitors to combat drug resistance HIV-1 protease variants. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are crucial drugs in highly active antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infections. However, resistance owing to mutations challenge the long-term efficacy in the medication of HIV-1-infected individuals. Lopinavir (LPV) and darunavir (DRV), two second-generation drugs are the most potent among PIs, hustling the drug resistance when mutations occur in the active and nonactive site of the protease (PR). Herein, we strive for compounds that can stifle the function of wild-type (WT) HIV-1 PR along with four major single mutants (I54M, V82T, I84V, and L90M) instigating resistance to the PIs using in silico approach. Six common compounds are retrieved from six databases using combined pharmacophore-based and structure-based virtual screening methodology. LPV and DRV are docked and the binding free energy is calculated to set the cut-off value for selecting compounds. Further, to gain insight into the stability of the complexes the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) is carried out, which uncovers two lead molecules namely NCI-524545 and ZINC12866729. Both the lead molecules connect with WT and mutant HIV-1 PRs through strong and stable hydrogen bond interactions when compared with LPV and DRV throughout the trajectory analysis. Interestingly, NCI-524545 and ZINC12866729 exhibit direct interactions with I50/50â€² by replacing the conserved water molecule as evidenced by MDS, which indicates the credible potency of these compounds. Hence, weÂ concluded that NCI-524545 and ZINC12866729 have great puissant to restrain the role of drug resistance HIV-1 PR variants, which can also show better activity through in vivo and in vitro conditions."
"Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Aid Discharge Processes for Inpatient Surgical Care. Importance: Inpatient overcrowding is associated with delays in care, including the deferral of surgical care until beds are available to accommodate postoperative patients. Timely patient discharge is critical to address inpatient overcrowding and requires coordination among surgeons, nurses, case managers, and others. This is difficult to achieve without early identification and systemwide transparency of discharge candidates and their respective barriers to discharge. Objective: To validate the performance of a clinically interpretable feedforward neural network model that could improve the discharge process by predicting which patients would be discharged within 24 hours and their clinical and nonclinical barriers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study included adult patients discharged from inpatient surgical care from May 1, 2016, to August 31, 2017, at a quaternary care teaching hospital. Model performance was assessed with standard cross-validation techniques. The model's performance was compared with a baseline model using historical procedure median length of stay to predict discharges. In prospective cohort analysis, the feedforward neural network model was used to make predictions on general surgical care floors with 63 beds. If patients were not discharged when predicted, the causes of delay were recorded. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model. Secondary outcomes included the causes of discharge delay and the number of avoidable bed-days. Results: The model was trained on 15â€¯201 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60 [46-70] years; 7623 [50.1%] men) discharged from inpatient surgical care. The estimated out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.840 (SD, 0.008; 95% CI, 0.839-0.844). Compared with the baseline model, the neural network model had higher sensitivity (52.5% vs 56.6%) and specificity (51.7% vs 82.6%). The neural network model identified 65 barriers to discharge. In the prospective study of 605 patients, causes of delays included clinical barriers (41 patients [30.1%]), variation in clinical practice (30 patients [22.1%]), and nonclinical reasons (65 patients [47.8%]). Summing patients who were not discharged owing to variation in clinical practice and nonclinical reasons, 128 bed-days, or 1.2 beds per day, were classified as avoidable. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that a neural network model could predict daily inpatient surgical care discharges and their barriers. The model identified systemic causes of discharge delays. Such models should be studied for their ability to increase the timeliness of discharges."
"Using an artificial neural network to map cancer common data elements to the biomedical research integrated domain group model in a semi-automated manner. BACKGROUND: The medical community uses a variety of data standards for both clinical and research reporting needs. ISO 11179 Common Data Elements (CDEs) represent one such standard that provides robust data point definitions. Another standard is the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model, which is a domain analysis model that provides a contextual framework for biomedical and clinical research data. Mapping the CDEs to the BRIDG model is important; in particular, it can facilitate mapping the CDEs to other standards. Unfortunately, manual mapping, which is the current method for creating the CDE mappings, is error-prone and time-consuming; this creates a significant barrier for researchers who utilize CDEs. METHODS: In this work, we developed a semi-automated algorithm to map CDEs to likely BRIDG classes. First, we extended and improved our previously developed artificial neural network (ANN) alignment algorithm. We then used a collection of 1284 CDEs with robust mappings to BRIDG classes as the gold standard to train and obtain the appropriate weights of six attributes in CDEs. Afterward, we calculated the similarity between a CDE and each BRIDG class. Finally, the algorithm produces a list of candidate BRIDG classes to which the CDE of interest may belong. RESULTS: For CDEs semantically similar to those used in training, a match rate of over 90% was achieved. For those partially similar, a match rate of 80% was obtained and for those with drastically different semantics, a match rate of up to 70% was achieved. DISCUSSION: Our semi-automated mapping process reduces the burden of domain experts. The weights are all significant in six attributes. Experimental results indicate that the availability of training data is more important than the semantic similarity of the testing data to the training data. We address the overfitting problem by selecting CDEs randomly and adjusting the ratio of training and verification samples. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results on real-world use cases have proven the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodology in mapping CDEs with BRIDG classes, both those CDEs seen before as well as new, unseen CDEs. In addition, it reduces the mapping burden and improves the mapping quality."
"The physiological determinants of near-infrared spectroscopy-derived regional cerebral oxygenation in critically ill adults. Background: To maintain adequate oxygen delivery to tissue, resuscitation of critically ill patients is guided by assessing surrogate markers of perfusion. As there is no direct indicator of cerebral perfusion used in routine critical care, identifying an accurate strategy to monitor brain perfusion is paramount. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique to quantify regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) that has been used for decades during cardiac surgery which has led to targeted algorithms to optimize rSO2 being developed. However, these targeted algorithms do not exist during critical care, as the physiological determinants of rSO2 during critical illness remain poorly understood. Materials and methods: This prospective observational study was an exploratory analysis of a nested cohort of patients within the CONFOCAL study (NCT02344043) who received high-fidelity vital sign monitoring. Adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years) admitted < 24 h to a medical/surgical intensive care unit were eligible if they had shock and/or required mechanical ventilation. Patients underwent rSO2 monitoring with the FORESIGHT oximeter for 24 h, vital signs were concurrently recorded, and clinically ordered arterial blood gas samples and hemoglobin concentration were also documented. Simultaneous multiple linear regression was performed using all available predictors, followed by model selection using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). Results: Our simultaneous multivariate model included age, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, pH, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and hemoglobin concentration. This model accounted for a significant proportion of variance in rSO2 (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.01) and was significantly associated with PaCO2 (p < 0.05) and hemoglobin concentration (p < 0.01). Our selected regression model using AICc accounted for a significant proportion of variance in rSO2 (R2 = 0.54, p < 0.01) and was significantly related to age (p < 0.05), PaCO2 (p <Â 0.01), hemoglobin (p < 0.01), and heart rate (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Known and established physiological determinants of oxygen delivery accounted for a significant proportion of the rSO2 signal, which provides evidence that NIRS is a viable modality to assess cerebral oxygenation in critically ill adults. Further elucidation of the determinants of rSO2 has the potential to develop a NIRS-guided resuscitation algorithm during critical illness. Trial registration: This trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02344043), retrospectively registered January 8, 2015."
"S100P is a molecular determinant of E-cadherin function in gastric cancer. Background: E-cadherin has been awarded a key role in the aetiology of both sporadic and hereditary forms of gastric cancer. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular interactors that influence the expression and function of E-cadherin associated to cancer. Methods: A data mining approach was used to predict stomach-specific candidate genes, uncovering S100P as a key candidate. The role of S100P was evaluated through in vitro functional assays and its expression was studied in a gastric cancer tissue microarray (TMA). Results: S100P was found to contribute to a cancer pathway dependent on the context of E-cadherin function. In particular, we demonstrated that S100P acts as an E-cadherin positive regulator in a wild-type E-cadherin context, and its inhibition results in decreased E-cadherin expression and function. In contrast, S100P is likely to be a pro-survival factor in gastric cancer cells with loss of functional E-cadherin, contributing to an oncogenic molecular program. Moreover, expression analysis in a gastric cancer TMA revealed that S100P expression impacts negatively among patients bearing Ecad- tumours, despite not being significantly associated with overall survival on its own. Conclusions: We propose that S100P has a dual role in gastric cancer, acting as an oncogenic factor in the context of E-cadherin loss and as a tumour suppressor in a functional E-cadherin setting. The discovery of antagonist effects of S100P in different E-cadherin contexts will aid in the stratification of gastric cancer patients who may benefit from S100P-targeted therapies.

"Identifying undetected dementia in UK primary care patients: a retrospective case-control study comparing machine-learning and standard epidemiological approaches. BACKGROUND: Identifying dementia early in time, using real world data, is a public health challenge. As only two-thirds of people with dementia now ultimately receive a formal diagnosis in United Kingdom health systems and many receive it late in the disease process, there is ample room for improvement. The policy of the UK government and National Health Service (NHS) is to increase rates of timely dementia diagnosis. We used data from general practice (GP) patient records to create a machine-learning model to identify patients who have or who are developing dementia, but are currently undetected as having the condition by the GP. METHODS: We used electronic patient records from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Using a case-control design, we selected patients aged >65y with a diagnosis of dementia (cases) and matched them 1:1 by sex and age to patients with no evidence of dementia (controls). We developed a list of 70 clinical entities related to the onset of dementia and recorded in the 5â€‰years before diagnosis. After creating binary features, we trialled machine learning classifiers to discriminate between cases and controls (logistic regression, naÃ¯ve Bayes, support vector machines, random forest and neural networks). We examined the most important features contributing to discrimination. RESULTS: The final analysis included data on 93,120 patients, with a median age of 82.6â€‰years; 64.8% were female. The naÃ¯ve Bayes model performed least well. The logistic regression, support vector machine, neural network and random forest performed very similarly with an AUROC of 0.74. The top features retained in the logistic regression model were disorientation and wandering, behaviour change, schizophrenia, self-neglect, and difficulty managing. CONCLUSIONS: Our model could aid GPs or health service planners with the early detection of dementia. Future work could improve the model by exploring the longitudinal nature of patient data and modelling decline in function over time."
"Applying deep matching networks to Chinese medical question answering: a study and a dataset. BACKGROUND: Medical and clinical question answering (QA) is highly concerned by researchers recently. Though there are remarkable advances in this field, the development in Chinese medical domain is relatively backward. It can be attributed to the difficulty of Chinese text processing and the lack of large-scale datasets. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a Chinese medical QA dataset and proposes effective methods for the task. METHODS: We first construct a large scale Chinese medical QA dataset. Then we leverage deep matching neural networks to capture semantic interaction between words in questions and answers. Considering that Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) tools may fail to identify clinical terms, we design a module to merge the word segments and produce a new representation. It learns the common compositions of words or segments by using convolutional kernels and selects the strongest signals by windowed pooling. RESULTS: The best performer among popular CWS tools on our dataset is found. In our experiments, deep matching models substantially outperform existing methods. Results also show that our proposed semantic clustered representation module improves the performance of models by up to 5.5% Precision at 1 and 4.9% Mean Average Precision. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we introduce a large scale Chinese medical QA dataset and cast the task into a semantic matching problem. We also compare different CWS tools and input units. Among the two state-of-the-art deep matching neural networks, MatchPyramid performs better. Results also show the effectiveness of the proposed semantic clustered representation module."
"Clinical validation of the FLIP algorithm and the SAF score in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Histological classifications used to diagnose/stage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are based on morphology, with undetermined clinical correlates and relevance. We assessed the clinical relevance of the fatty liver inhibition of progression (FLIP) algorithm and the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) scoring system. METHODS: One hundred and forty consecutive patients with suspected NAFLD and a separate validation cohort of 78 patients enrolled in a therapeutic trial, all with central reading of liver biopsy, were included. FLIP and SAF were used to categorize patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-NASH NAFLD (NAFL), or non-NAFLD. The SAF activity score assessed hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation; a histologically severe disease was defined as a SAF activity score of >/=3 and/or bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. Clinical, biochemical, and metabolic data were analyzed in relation to histology. RESULTS: Patients with NASH according to the FLIP algorithm had a clinical profile distinct from those with NAFL, with a higher prevalence of metabolic risk factors (increased body mass index [BMI], central obesity, serum glucose, and glycated hemoglobin), more severe insulin resistance (fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] values), and higher levels of aminotransferases. Similar findings were documented for patients with severe disease vs. those without. Positive linear trends existed between NASH or severe disease and increasing BMI and HOMA-IR. There was a strong association between liver fibrosis and NASH or SAF-defined scores of activity. Patients with either significant or bridging fibrosis overwhelmingly had NASH, and bridging fibrosis most often coexisted with severe activity. CONCLUSIONS: The FLIP algorithm/SAF score, although based on purely morphological grounds, are clinically relevant, as they identify patients with distinct clinical and biological profiles of disease severity. Disease activity in NAFLD is associated with fibrosis severity. LAY SUMMARY: The examination of liver tissue under the microscope (histology) serves to define the type and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease morphologically, and is also used to determine improvement in therapeutic or natural history clinical trials. The FLIP algorithm/SAF classification is a new histological classification well validated on morphological but not clinical grounds. Here, we demonstrate that different disease categories defined by the FLIP/SAF classification correspond to entities of different clinical and biological severity. We also show a strong association between the activity of steatohepatitis (defined histologically) and the amount of fibrotic scar."
"End-to-end lung cancer screening with three-dimensional deep learning on low-dose chest computed tomography. With an estimated 160,000 deaths in 2018, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States(1). Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography has been shown to reduce mortality by 20-43% and is now included in US screening guidelines(1-6). Existing challenges include inter-grader variability and high false-positive and false-negative rates(7-10). We propose a deep learning algorithm that uses a patient's current and prior computed tomography volumes to predict the risk of lung cancer. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art performance (94.4% area under the curve) on 6,716 National Lung Cancer Screening Trial cases, and performs similarly on an independent clinical validation set of 1,139 cases. We conducted two reader studies. When prior computed tomography imaging was not available, our model outperformed all six radiologists with absolute reductions of 11% in false positives and 5% in false negatives. Where prior computed tomography imaging was available, the model performance was on-par with the same radiologists. This creates an opportunity to optimize the screening process via computer assistance and automation. While the vast majority of patients remain unscreened, we show the potential for deep learning models to increase the accuracy, consistency and adoption of lung cancer screening worldwide."
"Urine organic acids as potential biomarkers for autism-spectrum disorder in chinese children. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that lacks clear biological biomarkers. Existing diagnostic methods focus on behavioral and performance characteristics, which complicates the diagnosis of patients younger than 3 years-old. The purpose of this study is to characterize metabolic features of ASD that could be used to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and exploration of ASD etiology. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to evaluate major metabolic fluctuations in 76 organic acids present in urine from 156 children with ASD and from 64 non-autistic children. Three algorithms, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used to develop models to distinguish ASD from typically developing (TD) children and to detect potential biomarkers. In an independent testing set, full model of XGBoost with all 76 acids achieved an AUR of 0.94, while reduced model with top 20 acids discovered by voting from these three algorithms achieved 0.93 and represent a good collection of potential ASD biomarkers. In summary, urine organic acids detection with GC/MS combined with XGBoost algorithm could represent a novel and accurate strategy for diagnosis of autism and the discovered potential biomarkers could be valuable for future research on the pathogenesis of autism and possible interventions."
"Brain metabolism modulates neuronal excitability in a mouse model of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Glucose is the ultimate substrate for most brain activities that use carbon, including synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid via mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Brain metabolism and neuronal excitability are thus interdependent. However, the principles that govern their relationship are not always intuitive because heritable defects of brain glucose metabolism are associated with the paradoxical coexistence, in the same individual, of episodic neuronal hyperexcitation (seizures) with reduced basal cerebral electrical activity. One such prototypic disorder is pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency (PDHD). PDH is central to metabolism because it steers most of the glucose-derived flux into the TCA cycle. To better understand the pathophysiology of PDHD, we generated mice with brain-specific reduced PDH activity that paralleled salient human disease features, including cerebral hypotrophy, decreased amplitude electroencephalogram (EEG), and epilepsy. The mice exhibited reductions in cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate content, spontaneous, and electrically evoked in vivo cortical field potentials and gamma EEG oscillation amplitude. Episodic decreases in gamma oscillations preceded most epileptiform discharges, facilitating their prediction. Fast-spiking neuron excitability was decreased in brain slices, contributing to in vivo action potential burst prolongation after whisker pad stimulation. These features were partially reversed after systemic administration of acetate, which augmented cerebral TCA cycle flux, glutamate-dependent synaptic transmission, inhibition and gamma oscillations, and reduced epileptiform discharge duration. Thus, our results suggest that dysfunctional excitability in PDHD is consequent to reduced oxidative flux, which leads to decreased neuronal activation and impaired inhibition, and can be mitigated by an alternative metabolic substrate."
"Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identify amino acid residues underlying the substrate selection mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporters 1 (hMCT1) and 4 (hMCT4). Human monocarboxylate transporters (hMCTs/SLC16As) mediate the transport of monocarboxylic compounds across plasma membranes. Among the hMCTs, hMCT1 and hMCT4 are expressed in various tissues, and transport substrates involved in energy metabolism. Both transporters mediate l-lactate transport, but, although hMCT1 also transports l-5-oxoproline (l-OPro), this compound is minimally transported by hMCT4. Thus, we were interested in the molecular mechanism responsible for the difference in substrate specificity between hMCT1 and hMCT4. Therefore, we generated 3D structure models of hMCT1 and hMCT4 to identify amino acid residues involved in the substrate specificity of these transporters. We found that the substrate specificity of hMCT1 was regulated by residues involved in turnover number (M69) and substrate affinity (F367), and these residues were responsible for recognizing (directly or indirectly) the â€“NHâ€“ moiety of l-OPro. Furthermore, our homology model of hMCT1 predicted that M69 and F367 participate in hydrophobic interactions with another region of hMCT1, emphasizing its potentially important role in the binding and translocation cycle of l-OPro. Mutagenesis experiments supported this model, showing that efficient l-OPro transport required a hydrophobic, long linear structure at position 69 and a hydrophobic, Î³-branched structure at position 367. Our work demonstrated that the amino acid residues, M69 and F367, are key molecular elements for the transport of l-OPro by hMCT1. These two residues may be involved in substrate recognition and/or substrate-induced conformational changes."
"ThalPred: a web-based prediction tool for discriminating thalassemia trait and iron deficiency anemia. BACKGROUND: The hypochromic microcytic anemia (HMA) commonly found in Thailand are iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia trait (TT). Accurate discrimination between IDA and TT is an important issue and better methods are urgently needed. Although considerable RBC formulas and indices with various optimal cut-off values have been developed, distinguishing between IDA and TT is still a challenging problem due to the diversity of various anemic populations. To address this problem, it is desirable to develop an improved and automated prediction model for discriminating IDA from TT. METHODS: We retrospectively collected laboratory data of HMA found in Thai adults. Five machine learnings, including k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), decision tree, random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to construct a discriminant model. Performance was assessed and compared with thirteen existing discriminant formulas and indices. RESULTS: The data of 186 patients (146 patients with TT and 40 with IDA) were enrolled. The interpretable rules derived from the RF model were proposed to demonstrate the combination of RBC indices for discriminating IDA from TT. A web-based tool 'ThalPred' was implemented using an SVM model based on seven RBC parameters. ThalPred achieved prediction results with an external accuracy, MCC and AUC of 95.59, 0.87 and 0.98, respectively. CONCLUSION: ThalPred and an interpretable rule were provided for distinguishing IDA from TT. For the convenience of health care team experimental scientists, a web-based tool has been established at http://codes.bio/thalpred/ by which users can easily get their desired screening test result without the need to go through the underlying mathematical and computational details."
"Interpreting patient-Specific risk prediction using contextual decomposition of BiLSTMs: application to children with asthma. BACKGROUND: Predictive modeling with longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data offers great promise for accelerating personalized medicine and better informs clinical decision-making. Recently, deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many healthcare prediction tasks. However, deep models lack interpretability, which is integral to successful decision-making and can lead to better patient care. In this paper, we build upon the contextual decomposition (CD) method, an algorithm for producing importance scores from long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). We extend the method to bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) and use it in the context of predicting future clinical outcomes using patients' EHR historical visits. METHODS: We use a real EHR dataset comprising 11071 patients, to evaluate and compare CD interpretations from LSTM and BiLSTM models. First, we train LSTM and BiLSTM models for the task of predicting which pre-school children with respiratory system-related complications will have asthma at school-age. After that, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis to evaluate the CD interpretations produced by the contextual decomposition of the trained models. In addition, we develop an interactive visualization to demonstrate the utility of CD scores in explaining predicted outcomes. RESULTS: Our experimental evaluation demonstrate that whenever a clear visit-level pattern exists, the models learn that pattern and the contextual decomposition can appropriately attribute the prediction to the correct pattern. In addition, the results confirm that the CD scores agree to a large extent with the importance scores generated using logistic regression coefficients. Our main insight was that rather than interpreting the attribution of individual visits to the predicted outcome, we could instead attribute a model's prediction to a group of visits. CONCLUSION: We presented a quantitative and qualitative evidence that CD interpretations can explain patient-specific predictions using CD attributions of individual visits or a group of visits."
"Elementary motion sequence detectors in whisker somatosensory cortex. How the somatosensory cortex (S1) encodes complex patterns of touch, such as those that occur during tactile exploration, is poorly understood. In the mouse whisker S1, temporally dense stimulation of local whisker pairs revealed that most neurons are not classical single-whisker feature detectors, but instead are strongly tuned to two-whisker sequences that involve the columnar whisker (CW) and one specific surround whisker (SW), usually in a SW-leading-CW order. Tuning was spatiotemporally precise and diverse across cells, generating a rate code for local motion vectors defined by SWâ€“CW combinations. Spatially asymmetric, sublinear suppression for suboptimal combinations and near-linearity for preferred combinations sharpened combination tuning relative to linearly predicted tuning. This resembles computation of motion direction selectivity in vision. SW-tuned neurons, misplaced in the classical whisker map, had the strongest combination tuning. Thus, each S1 column contains a rate code for local motion sequences involving the CW, thus providing a basis for higher-order feature extraction."
"A Rule-Out Strategy Based on High-Sensitivity Troponin and HEART Score Reduces Hospital Admissions. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate whether a combination of a 1-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin algorithm and History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) score reduces admission rate (primary outcome) and affects time to discharge, health care-related costs, and 30-day outcome (secondary outcomes) in patients with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: This prospective observational multicenter study was conducted before (2013 to 2014) and after (2015 to 2016) implementation of a strategy including level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T or I at 0 and 1 hour, combined with the HEART score. Patients with a nonelevated baseline high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level, a 1-hour change in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T level less than 3 ng/L, or high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I level less than 6 ng/L and a HEART score less than or equal to 3 were considered to be ruled out of having acute coronary syndrome. A logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1,233 patients were included at 6 centers. There were no differences in regard to median age (64 versus 63 years) and proportion of men (57% versus 54%) between the periods. After introduction of the new strategy, the admission rate decreased from 59% to 33% (risk ratio 0.55 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.48 to 0.63]; odds ratio 0.33 [95% CI 0.26 to 0.42]; adjusted odds ratio 0.33 [95% CI 0.25 to 0.42]). The median hospital stay was reduced from 23.2 to 4.7 hours (95% CI of difference -20.4 to -11.4); median health care-related costs, from $1,748 to $1,079 (95% CI of difference -$953 to -$391). The number of clinical events was very low. CONCLUSION: In this before-after study, clinical implementation of a 1-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin algorithm combined with the HEART score was associated with a reduction in admission rate and health care burden, with very low rates of adverse clinical events."
"A novel Rhein derivative: Activation of Rac1/NADPH pathway enhances sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells to radiotherapy. Radiation resistance and recurrent have become the major factors resulting in poor prognosis in the clinical treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). New strategies to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy have been focused on the development of radiosensitizers and searching for directly targets that modulated tumor radiosensitivity. A novel potential radiosensitizer 1,8-Dihydroxy âˆ’3-(2â€²-(4â€³-methylpiperazin-1â€³-yl) ethyl-9,10-anthraquinone âˆ’3-carboxylate (RP-4) was designed and synthesized based on molecular docking technology, which was expected to regulate the radiosensitivity of tumor cells through targeting Rac1. In order to assess the radiosensitization activity of RP-4 on NPC cells, the highly differentiated CNE1 and poorly differentiated CNE2 cells NPC lines were employed. According to the results, RP-4 showed higher binding affinity toward the interaction with Rac1 than lead compounds. We found that RP-4 could inhibit cell viability and proliferation in CNE1 and CNE2 cells and significantly induced apoptosis after non-toxic concentration of RP-4 combined with 2Gy irradiation. RP-4 could effectively modulated the radiosensitivity both CNE1 cells and CNE2 cells through activating Rac1/NADPH signaling pathway and its downstream JNK/AP-1 pathway. What's more, Rac1/NADPH signaling pathway were significantly activated in Rac1-overexpressed CNE1 and CNE2 cells after treated with RP-4. Taken together, Rac1 and its downstream pathway may probably be the direct targets of RP-4 in regulating radiosensitivity of NPC cells, our finding provided a novel strategy for the development of therapeutic agents in response to tumorous radiation resistance."
"Virtual screening identifies a PIN1 inhibitor with possible antiovarian cancer effects. Peptidyl-prolyl cisâ€“trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that binds phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in proteins and catalyzes the cisâ€“trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds. PIN1 is overexpressed in several cancers including high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Since few therapies are effective against this cancer, PIN1 could be a therapeutic target but effective PIN1 inhibitors are lacking. To identify molecules with in vivo inhibitory effects on PIN1, we used consensus docking to model existing PIN1-ligand X-ray structures and to screen a chemical database for candidate inhibitors. Ten molecules were selected and tested in cellular assays, leading to the identification of VS10 that bound and inhibited PIN1. VS10 treatment reduced the viability of ovarian cancer cell lines by inducing proteasomal PIN1 degradation, without effects on PIN1 transcription, and also reduced the levels of downstream targets Î²-catenin, cyclin D1, and pSer473-Akt. VS10 is a selective PIN1 inhibitor that may offer new opportunities for treating PIN1-overexpressing tumors."
"Systematic profiling identifies PDLIM2 as a novel prognostic predictor for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Till now, no appropriate biomarkers for high-risk population screening and prognosis prediction have been identified for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, by the combined use of data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-oesophageal carcinoma (ESCA), we aimed to screen dysregulated genes with prognostic value in ESCC and the genetic and epigenetic alterations underlying the dysregulation. About 222 genes that had at least fourfold change in ESCC compared with adjacent normal tissues were identified using the microarray data in GDS3838. Among these genes, only PDLIM2 was associated with nodal invasion and overall survival (OS) at the same time. The high PDLIM2 expression group had significantly longer OS and its expression was independently associated with better OS (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.95, PÂ =Â 0.03), after adjustment for gender and pathologic stages. The expression of its exon 7/8/9/10 had the highest AUC value (0.724) and better prognostic value (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22-0.83, PÂ =Â 0.01) than total PDLIM2 expression. PDLIM2 DNA copy deletion was common in ESCC and was associated with decreased gene expression. The methylation status of two CpG sites (cg23696886 and cg20449614) in the proximal promoter region of PDLIM2 showed a moderate negative correlation with the gene expression in PDLIM2 copy neutral/amplification group. In conclusion, we infer that PDLIM2 expression might be a novel prognostic indicator for ESCC patients. Its exon 7/8/9/10 expression had the best prognostic value. Its down-regulation might be associated with gene-level copy deletion and promoter hypermethylation."
"Selecting precise reference normal tissue samples for cancer research using a deep learning approach. Background: Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered. Methods: We analyze RNA-Seq data processed from the same computational pipeline and systematically evaluate GTEx as a potential reference resource. We use those cancers that have adjacent normal tissues in TCGA as a benchmark for the evaluation. To correlate tumor samples and normal samples, we explore top varying genes, reduced features from principal component analysis, and encoded features from an autoencoder neural network. We first evaluate whether these methods can identify the correct tissue of origin from GTEx for a given cancer and then seek to answer whether disease expression signatures are consistent between those derived from TCGA and from GTEx. Results: Among 32 TCGA cancers, 18 cancers have less than 10 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. Among three methods, autoencoder performed the best in predicting tissue of origin, with 12 of 14 cancers correctly predicted. The reason for misclassification of two cancers is that none of normal samples from GTEx correlate well with any tumor samples in these cancers. This suggests that GTEx has matched tissues for the majority cancers, but not all. While using autoencoder to select proper normal samples for disease signature creation, we found that disease signatures derived from normal samples selected via an autoencoder from GTEx are consistent with those derived from adjacent samples from TCGA in many cases. Interestingly, choosing top 50 mostly correlated samples regardless of tissue type performed reasonably well or even better in some cancers. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that samples from GTEx can serve as reference normal samples for cancers, especially those do not have available adjacent tissue samples. A deep-learning based approach holds promise to select proper normal samples."
"GTX.Digest.VCF: An online NGS data interpretation system based on intelligent gene ranking and large-scale text mining. Background: An important task in the interpretation of sequencing data is to highlight pathogenic genes (or detrimental variants) in the field of Mendelian diseases. It is still challenging despite the recent rapid development of genomics and bioinformatics. A typical interpretation workflow includes annotation, filtration, manual inspection and literature review. Those steps are time-consuming and error-prone in the absence of systematic support. Therefore, we developed GTX.Digest.VCF, an online DNA sequencing interpretation system, which prioritizes genes and variants for novel disease-gene relation discovery and integrates text mining results to provide literature evidence for the discovery. Its phenotype-driven ranking and biological data mining approach significantly speed up the whole interpretation process. Results: The GTX.Digest.VCF system is freely available as a web portal at http://vcf.gtxlab.com for academic research. Evaluation on the DDD project dataset demonstrates an accuracy of 77% (235 out of 305 cases) for top-50 genes and an accuracy of 41.6% (127 out of 305 cases) for top-5 genes. Conclusions: GTX.Digest.VCF provides an intelligent web portal for genomics data interpretation via the integration of bioinformatics tools, distributed parallel computing, biomedical text mining. It can facilitate the application of genomic analytics in clinical research and practices."
"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Proteins EZH1 and EZH2 Regulate Timing of Postnatal Hepatocyte Maturation and Fibrosis by Repressing Genes With Euchromatic Promoters in Mice. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about mechanisms that underlie postnatal hepatocyte maturation and fibrosis at the chromatin level. We investigated the transcription of genes involved in maturation and fibrosis in postnatal hepatocytes of mice, focusing on the chromatin compaction the roles of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2. METHODS: Hepatocytes were isolated from mixed background C57BL/6J-C3H mice, as well as mice with liver-specific disruption of Ezh1 and/or Ezh2, at postnatal day 14 and 2 months after birth. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by RNA sequencing, H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and sonication-resistant heterochromatin sequencing (a method to map heterochromatin and euchromatin). Liver damage was characterized by histologic analysis. RESULTS: We found more than 3000 genes differentially expressed in hepatocytes during liver maturation from postnatal day 14 to month 2 after birth. Disruption of Ezh1 and Ezh2 in livers caused perinatal hepatocytes to differentiate prematurely and to express genes at postnatal day 14 that would normally be induced by month 2 and differentiate prematurely. Loss of Ezh1 and Ezh2 also resulted in liver fibrosis. Genes with H3K27me3-postive and H3K4me3-positive euchromatic promoters were prematurely induced in hepatocytes with loss of Ezh1 and Ezh2-these genes included those that regulate hepatocyte maturation, fibrosis, and genes not specifically associated with the liver lineage. CONCLUSIONS: The Polycomb repressive complex 2 proteins EZH1 and EZH2 regulate genes that control hepatocyte maturation and fibrogenesis and genes not specifically associated with the liver lineage by acting at euchromatic promoter regions. EZH1 and EZH2 thereby promote liver homeostasis and prevent liver damage. Strategies to manipulate Polycomb proteins might be used to improve hepatocyte derivation protocols or developed for treatment of patients with liver fibrosis."
"Identification of potential drugs targeting L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase of Chlamydia trachomatis: An integrative pharmacoinformatics approach. Chlamydia trachomatis (C.t) is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria, which is a major causative of infectious blindness and sexually transmitted diseases. A surge in multidrug resistance among chlamydial species has posed a challenge to adopt alternative drug targeting strategies. Recently, in C.t, L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (CtDAP-AT) is proven to be a potential drug target due its essential role in cell survival and host nonspecificity. Hence, in this study, a multilevel precision-based virtual screening of CtDAP-AT was performed to identify potential inhibitors, wherein, an integrative stringent scoring and filtration were performed by coupling, glide docking score, binding free energy, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, toxicity) prediction, density functional theory (quantum mechanics), and molecular dynamics simulation (molecular mechanics). On cumulative analysis, NSC_5485 (1,3-bis((7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)amino)-2-propanol) was found to be the most potential lead, as it showed higher order significance in terms of binding affinity, bonded interactions, favorable ADMET, chemical reactivity, and greater stabilization during complex formation. This is the first report on prioritization of small molecules from National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Maybridge data sets (341 519 compounds) towards targeting CtDAP-AT. Thus, the proposed compound shall aid in effective combating of a broad spectrum of C.t infections as it surpassed all the levels of prioritization."
"Integrated network analysis and machine learning approach for the identification of key genes of triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has attracted more attention compared with other breast cancer subtypes due to its aggressive nature, poor prognosis, and chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment with no other approved targeted therapy. Therefore, the study aimed to discover more promising therapeutic targets and investigating new insights of biological mechanism of TNBC. Six microarray data sets consisting of 463 non-TNBC and 405 TNBC samples were mined from Gene Expression Omnibus. The data sets were integrated by meta-analysis and identified 1075 differentially expressed genes. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed which consists of 486 nodes and 1932 edges, where 29 hub genes were obtained with high topological measures. Further, 16 features (hub genes), 12 upregulated (AURKB, CCNB2, CDC20, DDX18, EGFR, ENO1, MYC, NUP88, PLK1, PML, POLR2F, and SKP2) and four downregulated (CCND1, GLI3, SKP1, and TGFB3) were selected through machine learning correlation based feature selection method on training data set. A naÃ¯ve Bayes based classifier built using the expression profiles of 16 features (hub genes) accurately and reliably classify TNBC from non-TNBC samples in the validation test data set with a receiver operating curve of 0.93 to 0.98. Subsequently, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the hub genes were enriched in mitotic cell cycle processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that they were enriched in cell cycle pathways. Thus, the identified key hub genes and pathways highlighted in the study would enhance the understanding of molecular mechanism of TNBC which may serve as potential therapeutic target."
"Characterization of proteome variation during modern maize breeding. The success of modern maize breeding has been demonstrated by remarkable increases in productivity with tremendous modification of agricultural phenotypes over the last century. Although the underlying genetic changes of the maize adaptation from tropical to temperate regions have been extensively studied, our knowledge is limited regarding the accordance of protein and mRNA expression levels accompanying such adaptation. Here we conducted an integrative analysis of proteomic and transcriptomic changes in a maize association panel. The minimum extent of correlation between protein and RNA levels suggests that variation in mRNA expression is often not indicative of protein expression at a population scale. This is corroborated by the observation that mRNA- and protein-based coexpression networks are relatively independent of each other, and many pQTLs arise without the presence of corresponding eQTLs. Importantly, compared with transcriptome, the subtypes categorized by the proteome show a markedly high accuracy to resemble the genomic subpopulation. These findings suggest that proteome evolved under a greater evolutionary constraint than transcriptome during maize adaptation from tropical to temperate regions. Overall, the integrated multi-omics analysis provides a functional context to interpret gene expression variation during modern maize breeding."
"Application of machine learning methodology to assess the performance of DIABETIMSS program for patients with type 2 diabetes in family medicine clinics in Mexico. BACKGROUND: The study aimed to assess the performance of a multidisciplinary-team diabetes care program called DIABETIMSS on glycemic control of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, by using available observational patient data and machine-learning-based targeted learning methods. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health records and laboratory databases from the year 2012 to 2016 of T2D patients from six family medicine clinics (FMCs) delivering the DIABETIMSS program, and five FMCs providing routine care. All FMCs belong to the Mexican Institute of Social Security and are in Mexico City and the State of Mexico. The primary outcome was glycemic control. The study covariates included: patient sex, age, anthropometric data, history of glycemic control, diabetic complications and comorbidity. We measured the effects of DIABETIMSS program through 1) simple unadjusted mean differences; 2) adjusted via standard logistic regression and 3) adjusted via targeted machine learning. We treated the data as a serial cross-sectional study, conducted a standard principal components analysis to explore the distribution of covariates among clinics, and performed regression tree on data transformed to use the prediction model to identify patient sub-groups in whom the program was most successful. To explore the robustness of the machine learning approaches, we conducted a set of simulations and the sensitivity analysis with process-of-care indicators as possible confounders. RESULTS: The study included 78,894 T2D patients, from which 37,767patients received care through DIABETIMSS. The impact of DIABETIMSS ranged, among clinics, from 2 to 8% improvement in glycemic control, with an overall (pooled) estimate of 5% improvement. T2D patients with fewer complications have more significant benefit from DIABETIMSS than those with more complications. At the FMC's delivering the conventional model the predicted impacts were like what was observed empirically in the DIABETIMSS clinics. The sensitivity analysis did not change the overall estimate average across clinics. CONCLUSIONS: DIABETIMSS program had a small, but significant increase in glycemic control. The use of machine learning methods yields both population-level effects and pinpoints the sub-groups of patients the program benefits the most. These methods exploit the potential of routine observational patient data within complex healthcare systems to inform decision-makers."
"Using machine learning models to improve stroke risk level classification methods of China national stroke screening. BACKGROUND: With the character of high incidence, high prevalence and high mortality, stroke has brought a heavy burden to families and society in China. In 2009, the Ministry of Health of China launched the China national stroke screening and intervention program, which screens stroke and its risk factors and conducts high-risk population interventions for people aged above 40â€‰years old all over China. In this program, stroke risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, lack of exercise, apparently overweight and family history of stroke. People with more than two risk factors or history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are considered as high-risk. However, it is impossible for this criterion to classify stroke risk levels for people with unknown values in fields of risk factors. The missing of stroke risk levels results in reduced efficiency of stroke interventions and inaccuracies in statistical results at the national level. In this paper, we use 2017 national stroke screening data to develop stroke risk classification models based on machine learning algorithms to improve the classification efficiency. METHOD: Firstly, we construct training set and test sets and process the imbalance training set based on oversampling and undersampling method. Then, we develop logistic regression model, NaÃ¯ve Bayesian model, Bayesian network model, decision tree model, neural network model, random forest model, bagged decision tree model, voting model and boosting model with decision trees to classify stroke risk levels. RESULT: The recall of the boosting model with decision trees is the highest (99.94%), and the precision of the model based on the random forest is highest (97.33%). Using the random forest model (recall: 98.44%), the recall will be increased by about 2.8% compared with the method currently used, and several thousands more people with high risk of stroke can be identified each year. CONCLUSION: Models developed in this paper can improve the current screening method in the way that it can avoid the impact of unknown values, and avoid unnecessary rescreening and intervention expenditures. The national stroke screening program can choose classification models according to the practice need."
"Radiomics versus Visual and Histogram-based Assessment to Identify Atheromatous Lesions at Coronary CT Angiography: An ex Vivo Study. Background Visual and histogram-based assessments of coronary CT angiography have limited accuracy in the identification of advanced lesions. Radiomics-based machine learning (ML) could provide a more accurate tool. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of radiomics-based ML with that of visual and histogram-based assessment of ex vivo coronary CT angiography cross sections to identify advanced atherosclerotic lesions defined with histologic examination. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 21 coronary arteries from seven hearts obtained from male donors (mean age, 52.3 years +/- 5.3) were imaged ex vivo with coronary CT angiography between February 23, 2009, and July 31, 2010. From 95 coronary plaques, 611 histologic cross sections were coregistered with coronary CT cross sections. Lesions were considered advanced if early fibroatheroma, late fibroatheroma, or thin-cap atheroma was present. CT cross sections were classified as showing homogeneous, heterogeneous, or napkin-ring sign plaques on the basis of visual assessment. The area of low attenuation (<30 HU) and the average Hounsfield unit were quantified. Radiomic parameters were extracted and used as inputs to ML algorithms. Eight radiomics-based ML models were trained on randomly selected cross sections (training set, 75% of the cross sections) to identify advanced lesions. Visual assessment, histogram-based assessment, and the best ML model were compared on the remaining 25% of the data (validation set) by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to identify advanced lesions. Results After excluding sections with no visible plaque (n = 134) and with heavy calcium (n = 32), 445 cross sections were analyzed. Of those 445 cross sections, 134 (30.1%) were advanced lesions. Visual assessment of the 445 cross sections indicated that 207 (46.5%) were homogeneous, 200 (44.9%) were heterogeneous, and 38 (8.5%) demonstrated the napkin-ring sign. A radiomics-based ML model incorporating 13 parameters outperformed visual assessment (AUC = 0.73 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.63, 0.84 vs 0.65 with 95% CI of 0.56, 0.73, respectively; P = .04), area of low attenuation (AUC = 0.55 with 95% CI of 0.42, 0.68; P = .01), and average Hounsfield unit (AUC = 0.53 with 95% CI of 0.42, 0.65; P = .004) in the identification of advanced atheromatous lesions. Conclusion Radiomics-based machine learning analysis improves the discriminatory power of coronary CT angiography in the identification of advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

"Machine learning in medicine: a practical introduction. BACKGROUND: Following visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. METHODS: We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. RESULTS: The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. CONCLUSIONS: We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition."
"Alisol A attenuates high-fat-diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders via the AMPK/ACC/SREBP-1c pathway. Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hepatic steatosis and chronic heart diseases are affecting billions of individuals. However there is no satisfactory drug to treat such diseases. In this study, we found that alisol A, a major active triterpene isolated from the Chinese traditional medicine Rhizoma Alismatis, could significantly attenuate high-fat-diet-induced obesity. Our biochemical detection demonstrated that alisol A remarkably decreased lipid levels, alleviated glucose metabolism disorders and insulin resistance in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. We also found that alisol A reduced hepatic steatosis and improved liver function in the obese mice model.In addition, protein expression investigation revealed that alisol A had an active effect on AMPK/ACC/SREBP-1c pathway. As suggested by the molecular docking study, such bioactivity of alisol A may result from its selective binding to the catalytic region of AMPK.Therefore, we believe that Alisol A could serve as a promising agent for treatment of obesity and its related metabolic diseases."
"Clinicopathological Features of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Epigenetic Subtypes. Background/Objective: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous collection of breast tumors with numerous differences including morphological characteristics, genetic makeup, immune-cell infiltration, and response to systemic therapy. DNA methylation profiling is a robust tool to accurately identify disease-specific subtypes. We aimed to generate an epigenetic subclassification of TNBC tumors (epitypes) with utility for clinical decision-making. Methods: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from TNBC patients generated in the Cancer Genome Atlas project were used to build machine learning-based epigenetic classifiers. Clinical and demographic variables, as well as gene expression and gene mutation data from the same cohort, were integrated to further refine the TNBC epitypes. Results: This analysis indicated the existence of four TNBC epitypes, named as Epi-CL-A, Epi-CL-B, Epi-CL-C, and Epi-CL-D. Patients with Epi-CL-B tumors showed significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival [log rank; P = 0.01; hazard ratio (HR) 3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3â€“11.63 and P = 0.003; HR 5.29, 95% CI 1.55â€“18.18, respectively]. Significant gene expression and mutation differences among the TNBC epitypes suggested alternative pathway activation that could be used as ancillary therapeutic targets. These epigenetic subtypes showed complementarity with the recently described TNBC transcriptomic subtypes. Conclusions: TNBC epigenetic subtypes exhibit significant clinical and molecular differences. The links between genetic make-up, gene expression programs, and epigenetic subtypes open new avenues in the development of laboratory tests to more efficiently stratify TNBC patients, helping optimize tailored treatment approaches."
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Revise ACR TI-RADS Risk Stratification of Thyroid Nodules: Diagnostic Accuracy and Utility. Background Risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies. Purpose To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). Materials and Methods A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients (1026 women; mean age, 52.9 years [range, 18-93 years]) were evaluated retrospectively. Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci), and a genetic AI algorithm was applied to a training set (1325 nodules). Point and pathologic data were used to create an optimized scoring system (hereafter, AI TI-RADS). Performance of the systems was compared by using a test set of the final 100 nodules with interpretations from the expert reader, eight nonexpert readers, and an expert panel. Initial performance of AI TI-RADS was calculated by using a test for differences between binomial proportions. Additional comparisons across readers were conducted by using bootstrapping; diagnostic performance was assessed by using area under the receiver operating curve. Results AI TI-RADS assigned new point values for eight ACR TI-RADS features. Six features were assigned zero points, which simplified categorization. By using expert reader data, the diagnostic performance of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS was area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. For the same expert, specificity of AI TI-RADS (65%, 55 of 85) was higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (47%, 40 of 85). For the eight nonexpert radiologists, mean specificity for AI TI-RADS (55%) was also higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (48%). An interactive AI TI-RADS calculator can be viewed at http://deckard.duhs.duke.edu/ approximately ai-ti-rads . Conclusion An artificial intelligence-optimized Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) validates the American College of Radiology TI-RADS while slightly improving specificity and maintaining sensitivity. Additionally, it simplifies feature assignments, which may improve ease of use. (c) RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
"Small molecule nAS-E targeting cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and CREB-binding protein interaction inhibits breast cancer bone metastasis. Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer. The excessive osteoclast activity in the metastatic bone lesions often produces osteolysis. The cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB) serves a variety of biological functions including the transformation and immortalization of breast cancer cells. In addition, evidence has shown that CREB plays a key role in osteoclastgenesis and bone resorption. Small organic molecules with good pharmacokinetic properties and specificity, targeting CREB-CBP (CREB-binding protein) interaction to inhibit CREB-mediated gene transcription have attracted more considerations as cancer therapeutics. We recently identified naphthol AS-E (nAS-E) as a cell-permeable inhibitor of CREB-mediated gene transcription through inhibiting CREB-CBP interaction. In this study, we tested the effect of nAS-E on breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration as well as osteoclast formation and bone resorption in vitro for the first time. Our results demonstrated that nAS-E inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, survival and suppressed osteoclast differentiation as well as bone resorption through inhibiting CREB-CBP interaction. In addition, the in vivo effect of nAS-E in protecting against breast cancer-induced osteolysis was evaluated. Our results indicated that nAS-E could reverse bone loss induced by MDA-MB-231 tumour. These results suggest that small molecules targeting CREB-CBP interaction to inhibit CREB-mediated gene transcription might be a potential approach for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis."
"Single-cell, high-throughput analysis of cell docking to vessel wall. Therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been reported consistently in animal models of stroke, with mechanism mainly through immunomodulation and paracrine activity. Intravenous injection has been a prevailing route for MSCs administration, but cell quantities needed when scaling-up from mouse to human are extremely high putting into question feasibility of that approach. Intra-arterial delivery directly routes the cells to the brain thus lowering the required dose. Cell engineering may additionally improve cell homing, further potentiating the value of intra-arterial route. Therefore, our goal was to create microfluidic platform for screening and fast selection of molecules that enhance the docking of stem cells to vessel wall. We hypothesized that our software will be capable of detecting distinct docking properties of naÃ¯ve and ITGA4-engineered MSCs. Indeed, the cell flow tracker analysis revealed positive effect of cell engineering on docking frequency of MSCs (42% vs. 9%, engineered vs. control cells, p < 0.001). These observations were then confirmed in an animal model of focal brain injury where cell engineering resulted in improved homing to the brain. To conclude, we developed a platform to study the docking of cells to the vessel wall which is highly relevant for intraarterial cell targeting or studies on neuroinflammation."
"Safety and Efficacy of Antithrombotic Strategies in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. Importance: The antithrombotic treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease, in particular with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), poses a significant treatment dilemma in clinical practice. Objective: To study the safety and efficacy of different antithrombotic regimens using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in this population. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing antithrombotic regimens. Study Selection: Four randomized studies were included (n = 10026; WOEST, PIONEER AF-PCI, RE-DUAL PCI, and AUGUSTUS). Data Extraction and Synthesis: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used in this systematic review and network meta-analysis between 4 regimens using a Bayesian random-effects model. A pre hoc statistical analysis plan was written, and the review protocol was registered at PROSPERO. Data were analyzed between November 2018 and February 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary safety outcome was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding; secondary safety outcomes were combined TIMI major and minor bleeding, trial-defined primary bleeding events, intracranial hemorrhage, and hospitalization. The primary efficacy outcome was trial-defined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); secondary efficacy outcomes were individual components of MACE. Results: The overall prevalence of ACS varied from 28% to 61%. The mean age ranged from 70 to 72 years; 20% to 29% of the trial population were women; and most patients were at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events. Compared with a regimen of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin), the odds ratios (ORs) for TIMI major bleeding were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.31-1.08) for VKA plus P2Y12 inhibitor, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.30-0.82) for non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC) plus P2Y12 inhibitor, and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.38-1.23) for NOAC plus DAPT. Compared with VKA plus DAPT, the ORs for MACE were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.60-1.46) for VKA plus P2Y12 inhibitor, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.71-1.47) for NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.60-1.45) for NOAC plus DAPT. Conclusions and Relevance: A regimen of NOACs plus P2Y12 inhibitor was associated with less bleeding compared with VKAs plus DAPT. Strategies omitting aspirin caused less bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, without significant difference in MACE, compared with strategies including aspirin. Our results support the use of NOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor as the preferred regimen post-percutaneous coronary intervention for these high-risk patients with AF. A regimen of VKA plus DAPT should generally be avoided."
"Validation of the Decipher Test for Predicting Distant Metastatic Recurrence in Men with High-risk Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer 10 Years After Surgery. We investigated the prognostic role of Decipher among patients with high-risk prostate cancer. In European and US cohorts, each 10% increase in the Decipher score translated to a 53% and 58% increase in the risk of distant metastases, respectively, within 10 yr."
"A De Novo Shape Motif Discovery Algorithm Reveals Preferences of Transcription Factors for DNA Shape Beyond Sequence Motifs. DNA shape adds specificity to sequence motifs but has not been explored systematically outside this context. We hypothesized that DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) preferentially occupy DNA with specific structures (â€œshape motifsâ€) regardless of whether or not these correspond to high information content sequence motifs. We present ShapeMF, a Gibbs sampling algorithm that identifies de novo shape motifs. Using binding data from hundreds of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that most DBPs have shape motifs and can occupy these in the absence of sequence motifs. This â€œshape-only bindingâ€ is common for many DBPs and in regions co-bound by multiple DBPs. When shape and sequence motifs co-occur, they can be overlapping, flanking, or separated by consistent spacing. Finally, DBPs within the same protein family have different shape motifs, explaining their distinct genome-wide occupancy despite having similar sequence motifs. These results suggest that shape motifs not only complement sequence motifs but also facilitate recognition of DNA beyond conventionally defined sequence motifs."
"Peptide selected by phage display increases survival of SH-SY5Y neurons comparable to brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a well-known neuroprotectant and a potent therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are several clinical concerns about its therapeutic applications. In the current study, we designed and developed BDNF-mimicking small peptides as an alternative to circumvent these problems. A phage-displayed peptide library was screened using BDNF receptor (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type2 [NTRK2]) and evaluated by ELISA. The peptide sequences showed similarity to loop2 of BDNF, they were recognized as discontinuous epitopes though. Interestingly, in silico molecular docking showed strong interactions between the peptide three-dimensional models and the surface residues of the NTRK2 protein at the IgC2 domain. A consensus peptide sequence was then synthesized to generate a mimetic construct (named as RNYK). The affinity binding and function of this construct was confirmed by testing against the native structure of NTRK2 in SH-SY5Y cells in vitro using flow-cytometry and MTT assays, respectively. RNYK at 5 ng/mL prevented neuronal degeneration of all- trans-retinoic acid-treated SH-SY5Y with equal efficacy to or even better than BDNF at 50 ng/mL."
"Structural determinants of the APOBEC3G N-terminal domain for HIV-1 RNA association. APOBEC3G (A3G) is a cellular protein that inhibits HIV-1 infection through virion incorporation. The interaction of the A3G N-terminal domain (NTD) with RNA is essential for A3G incorporation in the HIV-1 virion. The interaction between A3G-NTD and RNA is not completely understood. The A3G-NTD is also recognized by HIV-1 Viral infectivity factor (Vif) and A3G-Vif binding leads to A3G degradation. Therefore, the A3G-Vif interaction is a target for the development of antiviral therapies that block HIV-1 replication. However, targeting the A3G-Vif interactions could disrupt the A3G-RNA interactions that are required for A3G's antiviral activity. To better understand A3G-RNA binding, we generated in silico docking models to simulate the RNA-binding propensity of A3G-NTD. We simulated the A3G-NTD residues with high RNA-binding propensity, experimentally validated our prediction by testing A3G-NTD mutations, and identified structural determinants of A3G-RNA binding. In addition, we found a novel amino acid residue, I26 responsible for RNA interaction. The new structural insights provided here will facilitate the design of pharmaceuticals that inhibit A3G-Vif interactions without negatively impacting A3G-RNA interactions."
"Development and Performance of the Pulmonary Embolism Result Forecast Model (PERFORM) for Computed Tomography Clinical Decision Support. Importance: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening clinical problem, and computed tomographic imaging is the standard for diagnosis. Clinical decision support rules based on PE risk-scoring models have been developed to compute pretest probability but are underused and tend to underperform in practice, leading to persistent overuse of CT imaging for PE. Objective: To develop a machine learning model to generate a patient-specific risk score for PE by analyzing longitudinal clinical data as clinical decision support for patients referred for CT imaging for PE. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, the proposed workflow for the machine learning model, the Pulmonary Embolism Result Forecast Model (PERFORM), transforms raw electronic medical record (EMR) data into temporal feature vectors and develops a decision analytical model targeted toward adult patients referred for CT imaging for PE. The model was tested on holdout patient EMR data from 2 large, academic medical practices. A total of 3397 annotated CT imaging examinations for PE from 3214 unique patients seen at Stanford University hospitals and clinics were used for training and validation. The models were externally validated on 240 unique patients seen at Duke University Medical Center. The comparison with clinical scoring systems was done on randomly selected 100 outpatient samples from Stanford University hospitals and clinics and 101 outpatient samples from Duke University Medical Center. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prediction performance of diagnosing acute PE was evaluated using ElasticNet, artificial neural networks, and other machine learning approaches on holdout data sets from both institutions, and performance of models was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: Of the 3214 patients included in the study, 1704 (53.0%) were women from Stanford University hospitals and clinics; mean (SD) age was 60.53 (19.43) years. The 240 patients from Duke University Medical Center used for validation included 132 women (55.0%); mean (SD) age was 70.2 (14.2) years. In the samples for clinical scoring system comparisons, the 100 outpatients from Stanford University hospitals and clinics included 67 women (67.0%); mean (SD) age was 57.74 (19.87) years, and the 101 patients from Duke University Medical Center included 59 women (58.4%); mean (SD) age was 73.06 (15.3) years. The best-performing model achieved an AUROC performance of predicting a positive PE study of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.91) on intrainstitutional holdout data with an AUROC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.72) on an external data set from Duke University Medical Center; superior AUROC performance and cross-institutional generalization of the model of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.87) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.82), respectively, were noted on holdout outpatient populations from both intrainstitutional and extrainstitutional data. Conclusions and Relevance: The machine learning model, PERFORM, may consider multitudes of applicable patient-specific risk factors and dependencies to arrive at a PE risk prediction that generalizes to new population distributions. This approach might be used as an automated clinical decision-support tool for patients referred for CT PE imaging to improve CT use."
"Recognizing ion ligand binding sites by SMO algorithm. Background: In many important life activities, the execution of protein function depends on the interaction between proteins and ligands. As an important protein binding ligand, the identification of the binding site of the ion ligands plays an important role in the study of the protein function. Results: In this study, four acid radical ion ligands (NO2-,CO32-,SO42-,PO43-) and ten metal ion ligands (Zn2+,Cu2+,Fe2+,Fe3+,Ca2+,Mg2+,Mn2+,Na+,K+,Co2+) are selected as the research object, and the Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm based on sequence information was proposed, better prediction results were obtained by 5-fold cross validation. Conclusions: An efficient method for predicting ion ligand binding sites was presented."
"The alexipharmic mechanisms of five licorice ingredients involved in CYP450 and Nrf2 pathways in paraquat-induced mice acute lung injury. Oxidative stress is an important mechanism in acute lung injury (ALI) induced by paraquat (PQ), one of the most widely used herbicides in developing countries. In clinical prophylaxis and treatment, licorice is a widely used herbal medicine in China due to its strong alexipharmic characteristics. However, the corresponding biochemical mechanism of antioxidation and detoxification enzymes induced by licorice's ingredients is still not fully demonstrated. In this study, the detoxification effect of licorice was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The detoxification and antioxidation effect of its active ingredients involved in the treatment was screened systematically according to Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME): Predictions and evidence-based literature mining methods in silico approach. Data shows that licorice alleviate pulmonary edema and fibrosis, decrease Malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and increase Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity in PQ-induced ALI mice, protect the morphologic appearance of lung tissues, induce cytochrome 3A4 (CYA3A4) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression to active detoxification pathways, reduce the accumulation of PQ in vivo, protect or improve the liver and renal function of mice, and increase the survival rate. The 104 genes of PPI network contained all targets of licorice ingredients and PQ, which displayed the two redox regulatory enzymatic group modules cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and Nrf2 via a score-related graphic theoretic clustering algorithm in silico. According to ADME properties, glycyrol, isolicoflavonol, licochalcone A, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and licoisoflavone A were employed due to their oral bioavailability OB â‰¤ 30%, drug-likeness DL â‰¤ 0 1, and being highly associated with CYP450 and Nrf2 pathways, as potential activators to halt PQ-induced cells death in vitro. Both 3A4 inhibitor and silenced Nrf2 gene decreased the alexipharmic effects of those ingredients significantly. All these disclosed the detoxification and antioxidation effects of licorice on acute lung injury induced by PQ, and glycyrol, isolicoflavonol, licochalcone A, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and licoisoflavone A upregulated CYP450 and Nrf2 pathways underlying the alexipharmic mechanisms of licorice."
"Discovery of N-phenyl-(2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine-5-sulfonamido) phenylurea-based thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor as a novel multi-effects antitumor drugs with minimal toxicity. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a hot target for tumor chemotherapy, and its inhibitors are an essential direction for anti-tumor drug research. To our knowledge, currently, there are no reported thymidylate synthase inhibitors that could inhibit cancer cell migration. Therefore, for optimal therapeutic purposes, combines our previous reports and findings, we hope to obtain a multi-effects inhibitor. This study according to the principle of flattening we designed and synthesized 18 of N-phenyl-(2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine-5-sulfonamido)phenyl urea derivatives as multi-effects inhibitors. The biological evaluation results showed that target compounds could significantly inhibit the hTS enzyme, BRaf kinase and EGFR kinase activity in vitro, and most of the compounds had excellent anti-cell viability for six cancer cell lines. Notably, the candidate compound L14e (IC50 = 0.67 Î¼M) had the superior anti-cell viability and safety to A549 and H460 cells compared with pemetrexed. Further studies had shown that L14e could cause G1/S phase arrest then induce intrinsic apoptosis. Transwell, western blot, and tube formation results proved that L14e could inhibit the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, then ultimately achieve the purpose of inhibiting cancer cell migration and angiogenesis in cancer tissues. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacology evaluations of L14e showed significant antitumor activity in A549 cells xenografts with minimal toxicity. All of these results demonstrated that the L14e has the potential for drug discovery as a multi-effects inhibitor and provides a new reference for clinical treatment of non-small cell lung cancer."
"Automated quantitative tumour response assessment of MRI in neuro-oncology with artificial neural networks: a multicentre, retrospective study. BACKGROUND: The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and requirements for a uniform protocol have been introduced to standardise assessment of MRI scans in both clinical trials and clinical practice. However, these criteria mainly rely on manual two-dimensional measurements of contrast-enhancing (CE) target lesions and thus restrict both reliability and accurate assessment of tumour burden and treatment response. We aimed to develop a framework relying on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for fully automated quantitative analysis of MRI in neuro-oncology to overcome the inherent limitations of manual assessment of tumour burden. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we compiled a single-institution dataset of MRI data from patients with brain tumours being treated at Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg, Germany; Heidelberg training dataset) to develop and train an ANN for automated identification and volumetric segmentation of CE tumours and non-enhancing T2-signal abnormalities (NEs) on MRI. Independent testing and large-scale application of the ANN for tumour segmentation was done in a single-institution longitudinal testing dataset from the Heidelberg University Hospital and in a multi-institutional longitudinal testing dataset from the prospective randomised phase 2 and 3 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-26101 trial (NCT01290939), acquired at 38 institutions across Europe. In both longitudinal datasets, spatial and temporal tumour volume dynamics were automatically quantified to calculate time to progression, which was compared with time to progression determined by RANO, both in terms of reliability and as a surrogate endpoint for predicting overall survival. We integrated this approach for fully automated quantitative analysis of MRI in neuro-oncology within an application-ready software infrastructure and applied it in a simulated clinical environment of patients with brain tumours from the Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg simulation dataset). FINDINGS: For training of the ANN, MRI data were collected from 455 patients with brain tumours (one MRI per patient) being treated at Heidelberg hospital between July 29, 2009, and March 17, 2017 (Heidelberg training dataset). For independent testing of the ANN, an independent longitudinal dataset of 40 patients, with data from 239 MRI scans, was collected at Heidelberg University Hospital in parallel with the training dataset (Heidelberg test dataset), and 2034 MRI scans from 532 patients at 34 institutions collected between Oct 26, 2011, and Dec 3, 2015, in the EORTC-26101 study were of sufficient quality to be included in the EORTC-26101 test dataset. The ANN yielded excellent performance for accurate detection and segmentation of CE tumours and NE volumes in both longitudinal test datasets (median DICE coefficient for CE tumours 0.89 [95% CI 0.86-0.90], and for NEs 0.93 [0.92-0.94] in the Heidelberg test dataset; CE tumours 0.91 [0.90-0.92], NEs 0.93 [0.93-0.94] in the EORTC-26101 test dataset). Time to progression from quantitative ANN-based assessment of tumour response was a significantly better surrogate endpoint than central RANO assessment for predicting overall survival in the EORTC-26101 test dataset (hazard ratios ANN 2.59 [95% CI 1.86-3.60] vs central RANO 2.07 [1.46-2.92]; p<0.0001) and also yielded a 36% margin over RANO (p<0.0001) when comparing reliability values (ie, agreement in the quantitative volumetrically defined time to progression [based on radiologist ground truth vs automated assessment with ANN] of 87% [266 of 306 with sufficient data] compared with 51% [155 of 306] with local vs independent central RANO assessment). In the Heidelberg simulation dataset, which comprised 466 patients with brain tumours, with 595 MRI scans obtained between April 27, and Sept 17, 2018, automated on-demand processing of MRI scans and quantitative tumour response assessment within the simulated clinical environment required 10 min of computation time (average per scan). INTERPRETATION: Overall, we found that ANN enabled objective and automated assessment of tumour response in neuro-oncology at high throughput and could ultimately serve as a blueprint for the application of ANN in radiology to improve clinical decision making. Future research should focus on prospective validation within clinical trials and application for automated high-throughput imaging biomarker discovery and extension to other diseases.

"Zinc ions increase GH signaling ability through regulation of available plasma membrane-localized GHR. It is well known that zinc ion (Zn2+) can regulate the biological activity of growth hormone (GH). However, until now, the mechanism by which Zn2+ regulates GH biological activity remains unclear. In the current study, we first performed molecular docking between Zn2+ and porcine GH (pGH) using computational biology. We then explored the effect of Zn2+ on the GH signaling ability in the cell model expressing porcine growth hormone receptor (GHR). It was found that the phosphorylation levels of Janus kinase 2, signal transducers and activators of transcription 5/3/1, and GHR increased significantly under Zn2+ treatment, indicating that Zn2+ can enhance the signaling ability of GH/GHR. On this basis, we further explored how Zn2+ regulates the biological activity of GH/GHR. The results showed that downregulation and turnover of GHR changed under Zn2+/pGH treatment. Zn2+ enhanced the membrane residence time of pGH/GHR and delayed GHR downregulation. Further investigation showed that the internalization dynamic of pGH/GHR was changed by Zn2+, which prolonged the residence time of pGH/GHR in the cell membrane. These factors acted together to upregulate the signaling of GH/GHR. This study lays a foundation for further exploration of the biological effects of Zn2+ on GH. (Figure presented.)."
"Synthesis and DNase I inhibitory properties of some 4-thiazolidinone derivatives. Twelve new thiazolidinones were synthesized and, together with 41 previously synthesized thiazolidinones,Â evaluated for inhibitory activity against deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) in vitro. Ten compounds inhibited commercial bovine pancreatic DNase I with an IC50 below 200 Î¼M and showed to be more potent DNase I inhibitors than crystal violet (IC50 = 365.90 Â± 47.33 Î¼M), used as a positive control. Moreover, three compounds were active against DNase I in rat liver homogenate, having an IC50 below 200 Î¼M. (3-Methyl-1,4-dioxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)-N-(2-phenylethyl)ethanamide (41) exhibited the most potent DNase I inhibition against both commercial and rat liver DNase I with IC50 values of 115.96 Â± 11.70 and 151.36 Â± 15.85 Î¼M, respectively. Site Finder and molecular docking defined the thiazolidinones interactions with the most important catalytic residues of DNase I, including the H-acceptor interaction with residues His 134 and His 252 and/or H-donor interaction with residues Glu 39 and Asp 168. The three most active compounds against both commercial and rat liver DNase I (31, 38, and 41) exhibited favorable physico-chemical, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological properties. These observations could be utilized to guide the rational design and optimization of novel thiazolidinone inhibitors. Thiazolidinones as novel DNase I inhibitors could have potential therapeutic applications due to the significant involvement of DNase I in the pathophysiology of many disease conditions."
"Assessment of Automated Identification of Phases in Videos of Cataract Surgery Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques. Importance: Competence in cataract surgery is a public health necessity, and videos of cataract surgery are routinely available to educators and trainees but currently are of limited use in training. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can yield tools that efficiently segment videos of cataract surgery into constituent phases for subsequent automated skill assessment and feedback. Objective: To evaluate machine learning and deep learning algorithms for automated phase classification of manually presegmented phases in videos of cataract surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a cross-sectional study using a data set of videos from a convenience sample of 100 cataract procedures performed by faculty and trainee surgeons in an ophthalmology residency program from July 2011 to December 2017. Demographic characteristics for surgeons and patients were not captured. Ten standard labels in the procedure and 14 instruments used during surgery were manually annotated, which served as the ground truth. Exposures: Five algorithms with different input data: (1) a support vector machine input with cross-sectional instrument label data; (2) a recurrent neural network (RNN) input with a time series of instrument labels; (3) a convolutional neural network (CNN) input with cross-sectional image data; (4) a CNN-RNN input with a time series of images; and (5) a CNN-RNN input with time series of images and instrument labels. Each algorithm was evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. Results: Unweighted accuracy for the 5 algorithms ranged between 0.915 and 0.959. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 5 algorithms ranged between 0.712 and 0.773, with small differences among them. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the image-only CNN-RNN (0.752) was significantly greater than that of the CNN with cross-sectional image data (0.712) (difference, -0.040; 95% CI, -0.049 to -0.033) and the CNN-RNN with images and instrument labels (0.737) (difference, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.018). While specificity was uniformly high for all phases with all 5 algorithms (range, 0.877 to 0.999), sensitivity ranged between 0.005 (95% CI, 0.000 to 0.015) for the support vector machine for wound closure (corneal hydration) and 0.974 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.991) for the RNN for main incision. Precision ranged between 0.283 and 0.963. Conclusions and Relevance: Time series modeling of instrument labels and video images using deep learning techniques may yield potentially useful tools for the automated detection of phases in cataract surgery procedures."
"iTRAQ-Based Global Phosphoproteomics Reveals Novel Molecular Differences Between Toxoplasma gondii Strains of Different Genotypes. To gain insights into differences in the virulence among T. gondii strains at the post-translational level, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome profile of T. gondii strains belonging to three different genotypes. Phosphopeptides from three strains, type I (RH strain), type II (PRU strain) and ToxoDB#9 (PYS strain), were enriched by titanium dioxide (TiO2) affinity chromatography and quantified using iTRAQ technology. A total of 1,441 phosphopeptides, 1,250 phosphorylation sites and 759 phosphoproteins were detected. In addition, 392, 298, and 436 differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DEPs) were identified in RH strain when comparing RH/PRU strains, in PRU strain when comparing PRU/PYS strains, and in PYS strain when comparing PYS/RH strains, respectively. Functional characterization of the DEPs using GO, KEGG, and STRING analyses revealed marked differences between the three strains. In silico kinase substrate motif analysis of the DEPs revealed three (RxxS, SxxE, and SxxxE), three (RxxS, SxxE, and SP), and five (SxxE, SP, SxE, LxRxxS, and RxxS) motifs in RH strain when comparing RH/PRU strains, in PRU strain when comparing PRU/PYS, and in PYS strain when comparing PYS/RH strains, respectively. This suggests that multiple overrepresented protein kinases including PKA, PKG, CKII, IKK, and MAPK could be involved in such a difference between T. gondii strains. Kinase associated network analysis showed that ROP5, ROP16, and cell-cycle-associated protein kinase CDK were the most connected kinase peptides. Our data reveal significant changes in the abundance of phosphoproteins between T. gondii genotypes, which explain some of the mechanisms that contribute to the virulence heterogeneity of this parasite."
"Artificial intelligence and computer-aided diagnosis in colonoscopy: current evidence and future directions. Computer-aided diagnosis offers a promising solution to reduce variation in colonoscopy performance. Pooled miss rates for polyps are as high as 22%, and associated interval colorectal cancers after colonoscopy are of concern. Optical biopsy, whereby in-vivo classification of polyps based on enhanced imaging replaces histopathology, has not been incorporated into routine practice because it is limited by interobserver variability and generally only meets accepted standards in expert settings. Real-time decision-support software has been developed to detect and characterise polyps, and also to offer feedback on the technical quality of inspection. Some of the current algorithms, particularly with recent advances in artificial intelligence techniques, match human expert performance for optical biopsy. In this Review, we summarise the evidence for clinical applications of computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence in colonoscopy."
"Platelet protein disulfide isomerase promotes glycoprotein ib&-mediated platelet-neutrophil interactions under thromboinflammatory conditions. Background: Platelet-neutrophil interactions contribute to vascular occlusion and tissue damage in thromboinflammatory disease. Platelet glycoprotein Ib& (GPIb&), a key receptor for the cell-cell interaction, is believed to be constitutively active for ligand binding. Here, we established the role of platelet-derived protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in reducing the allosteric disulfide bonds in GPIb& and enhancing the ligand-binding activity under thromboinflammatory conditions. Methods: Bioinformatic analysis identified 2 potential allosteric disulfide bonds in GPIb&. Agglutination assays, flow cytometry, surface plasmon resonance analysis, a protein-protein docking model, proximity ligation assays, and mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate a direct interaction between PDI and GPIb& and to determine a role for PDI in regulating GPIb& function and platelet-neutrophil interactions. Also, real-Time microscopy and animal disease models were used to study the pathophysiological role of PDI-GPIb& signaling under thromboinflammatory conditions. Results: Deletion or inhibition of platelet PDI significantly reduced GPIb&-mediated platelet agglutination. Studies using PDI-null platelets and recombinant PDI or Anfibatide, a clinical-stage GPIb& inhibitor, revealed that the oxidoreductase activity of platelet surface-bound PDI was required for the ligand-binding function of GPIb&. PDI directly bound to the extracellular domain of GPIb& on the platelet surface and reduced the Cys4-Cys17 and Cys209-Cys248 disulfide bonds. Real-Time microscopy with platelet-specific PDI conditional knockout and sickle cell disease mice demonstrated that PDI-regulated GPIb& function was essential for platelet-neutrophil interactions and vascular occlusion under thromboinflammatory conditions. Studies using a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced stroke indicated that PDI-GPIb& signaling played a crucial role in tissue damage. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that PDI-facilitated cleavage of the allosteric disulfide bonds tightly regulates GPIb& function, promoting platelet-neutrophil interactions, vascular occlusion, and tissue damage under thromboinflammatory conditions."
"Dual-Energy CT in Children: Imaging Algorithms and Clinical Applications. Dual-energy CT enables the simultaneous acquisition of CT images at two different x-ray energy spectra. By acquiring high- and low-energy spectral data, dual-energy CT can provide unique qualitative and quantitative information about tissue composition, allowing differentiation of multiple materials including iodinated contrast agents. The two dual-energy CT postprocessing techniques that best exploit the advantages of dual-energy CT in children are the material-decomposition images (which include virtual nonenhanced, iodine, perfused lung blood volume, lung vessel, automated bone removal, and renal stone characterization images) and virtual monoenergetic images. Clinical applications include assessment of the arterial system, lung perfusion, neoplasm, bowel diseases, renal calculi, tumor response to treatment, and metal implants. Of importance, the radiation exposure level of dual-energy CT is equivalent to or less than that of conventional single-energy CT. In this review, the authors discuss the basic principles of the dual-energy CT technologies and postprocessing techniques and review current clinical applications in the pediatric chest and abdomen."
"Structural insights of resveratrol with its binding partners in the toll-like receptor 4 pathway. The benefits associated with resveratrol (Resv; 3,4â€²,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) are known for a long time. The therapeutic properties of Resv are observed in diseases like cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, aging, inflammation, etc. Multiple studies suggest that the beneficial properties of Resv are due to its binding to targets in multiple pathways. The same has been reflected in inflammation, where Resv has been shown to inhibit nuclear factor Îº light-chain enhancer of activated B cells in the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway. There are multiple cellular targets which bind to Resv, however the mode and the key interactions involved remain elusive for many of them. In the current work, we have investigated the structural insights of Resv with three of its binding partners involved in the inflammatory TLR4 signaling pathway. Through a structure-based modelling and molecular dynamics study, we have unraveled the molecular and atomic interactions involved in the Resv-binary complexes of inhibitor of ÎºB kinase, cyclooxygeanse-2, and tank-binding kinase I, all three of which are key players in TLR4 inflammatory signaling. This study is the latest addition to the investigations of the structural partners of Resv and its molecular interactions."
"Effects of flow changes on radiotracer binding: Simultaneous measurement of neuroreceptor binding and cerebral blood flow modulation. The potential effects of changes in blood flow on the delivery and washout of radiotracers has been an ongoing question in PET bolus injection studies. This study provides practical insight into this topic by experimentally measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuroreceptor binding using simultaneous PET/MRI. Hypercapnic challenges (7% CO2) were administered to non-human primates in order to induce controlled increases in CBF, measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling. Simultaneously, dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding of [11C]raclopride or [18F]fallypride was monitored with dynamic PET. Experiments showed that neither time activity curves nor quantification of binding through binding potentials (BPND) were measurably affected by CBF increases, which were larger than two-fold. Simulations of experimental procedures showed that even large changes in CBF should have little effect on the time activity curves of radiotracers, given a set of realistic assumptions. The proposed method can be applied to experimentally assess the flow sensitivity of other radiotracers. Results demonstrate that CBF changes, which often occur due to behavioral tasks or pharmacological challenges, do not affect PET [11C]raclopride or [18F]fallypride binding studies and their quantification. The results from this study suggest flow effects may have limited impact on many PET neuroreceptor tracers with similar properties."
"Multi-institutional Clinical Tool for Predicting High-risk Lesions on 3 Tesla Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for prostate cancer detection without careful patient selection may lead to excessive resource utilization and costs. Objective: To develop and validate a clinical tool for predicting the presence of high-risk lesions on mpMRI. Design, setting, and participants: Four tertiary care centers were included in this retrospective and prospective study (BiRCH Study Collaborative). Statistical models were generated using 1269 biopsy-naive, prior negative biopsy, and active surveillance patients who underwent mpMRI. Using age, prostate-specific antigen, and prostate volume, a support vector machine model was developed for predicting the probability of harboring Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 or 5 lesions. The accuracy of future predictions was then prospectively assessed in 214 consecutive patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Receiver operating characteristic, calibration, and decision curves were generated to assess model performance. Results and limitations: For biopsy-naÃ¯ve and prior negative biopsy patients (n = 811), the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.730 on internal validation. Excellent calibration and high net clinical benefit were observed. On prospective external validation at two separate institutions (n = 88 and n = 126), the machine learning model discriminated with AUCs of 0.740 and 0.744, respectively. The final model was developed on the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning platform (birch.azurewebsites.net). This model requires a prostate volume measurement as input. Conclusions: In patients who are naÃ¯ve to biopsy or those with a prior negative biopsy, BiRCH models can be used to select patients for mpMRI. Patient summary: In this multicenter study, we developed and prospectively validated a calculator that can be used to predict prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results using patient age, prostate-specific antigen, and prostate volume as input. This tool can aid health care professionals and patients to make an informed decision regarding whether to get an MRI. Previously, there were no clinical tools to predict Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4â€“5 before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BiRCH models were developed to predict the MRI result using logistic regression and machine learning, and can be used to select patients for multiparametric MRI."
"The PI(4)P phosphatase Sac2 controls insulin granule docking and release. Insulin granule biogenesis involves transport to, and stable docking at, the plasma membrane before priming and fusion. Defects in this pathway result in impaired insulin secretion and are a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. We now show that the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatase Sac2 localizes to insulin granules in a substrate-dependent manner and that loss of Sac2 results in impaired insulin secretion. Sac2 operates upstream of granule docking, since loss of Sac2 prevented granule tethering to the plasma membrane and resulted in both reduced granule density and number of exocytic events. Sac2 levels correlated positively with the number of docked granules and exocytic events in clonal Ã¢ cells and with insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets, and Sac2 expression was reduced in islets from type 2 diabetic subjects. Taken together, we identified a phosphoinositide switch on the surface on insulin granules that is required for stable granule docking at the plasma membrane and impaired in human type 2 diabetes."
"Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals AML Hierarchies Relevant to Disease Progression and Immunity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that resides within a complex microenvironment, complicating efforts to understand how different cell types contribute to disease progression. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T cell activity in vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
"Casticin inhibits nasopharyngeal carcinoma growth by targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Background: Casticin, an isoflavone compound extracted from the herb Fructus Viticis, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities and properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of casticin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells and to determine its potential for targeted use as a medicine. Methods: NPC cells were used to perform the experiments. The CCK 8 assay and colony formation assays were used to assess cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle and apoptosis analysis (annexin V/PI assay). A three-dimensional (3D) tumour sphere culture system was used to characterize the effect of casticin on NPC stem cells. In silico molecular docking prediction and high-throughput KINOME scan assays were used to evaluate the binding of casticin to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), including wild-type and most of mutants variants. We also used the SelectScreen assay to detect the IC50 of ATP activity in the active site of the target kinase. Western blotting was used to evaluate the changes in key proteins involved cell cycle, apoptosis, stemness, and PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling. The effect of casticin treatment in vivo was determined by using a xenograft mouse model. Results: Our results indicate that casticin is a new and novel selective PI3K inhibitor that can significantly inhibit NPC proliferation and that it induces G2/GM arrest and apoptosis by upregulating Bax/BCL2 expression. Moreover, casticin was observed to affect the self-renewal ability of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, and a combination of casticin with BYL719 was observed to induce a decrease in the level of the phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets in BYL719-insensitive NPC cell lines. Conclusion: Casticin is a newly emerging selective PI3K inhibitor with potential for use as a targeted therapeutic treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Accordingly, casticin might represent a novel and effective agent against NPC and likely has high potential for combined use with pharmacological agents targeting PI3K/AKT."
"Activation of prolyl hydroxylase-2 for stabilization of mitochondrial stress along with simultaneous downregulation of HIF-1Î±/FASN in ERÂ +Â breast cancer subtype. The present study was undertaken to inquest the chemical activation of prolyl hydroxylase-2 for the curtailment of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± and fatty acid synthase. It was well documented that hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± and fatty acid synthase were overexpressed in mammary gland carcinomas. After screening a battery of compounds, BBAP-2 was retrieved as a potential prolyl hydroxylase-2 activator and validates its activity using ERÂ +Â MCF-7 cell line and n-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced rat in vivo model, respectively. BBAP-2 was palpable for the morphological characteristics of apoptosis along with changes in the mitochondrial intergrity as visualized by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and JC-1 staining against ERÂ +Â MCF-7 cells. BBAP-2 also arrest the cell cycle of ERÂ +Â MCF-7 cells at G2/M phase. Afterward, BBAP-2 has scrutinized against n-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced mammary gland carcinoma in albino Wistar rats. BBAP-2 restored the morphological architecture when screened through carmine staining, haematoxylin and eosin staining, and scanning electron microscopy. BBAP-2 also delineated the markers of oxidative stress favourably. The immunoblotting and mRNA expression analysis validated that BBAP-2 has a potentialty activate the prolyl hydroxylase-2 with sequential downregulating effect on hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± and its downstream checkpoint. BBAP-2 also fostered apoptosis through mitochondrial-mediated death pathway. The present study elaborates the chemical activation of prolyl hydroxylase-2 by which the increased expression of HIF-1Î± and FASN can be reduced in mammary gland carcinoma."
"A Review of and Algorithmic Approach to Soft Palate Reconstruction. Importance: The soft palate contributes to deglutition, articulation, and respiration. Current reconstructive techniques focus on restoration of both form and function. The unique challenges of soft palate reconstruction include maintenance of complex upper aerodigestive tract function, with minimal local or donor site morbidity. Objective: To review the literature on soft palate reconstruction and present an algorithm on how to approach soft palate defects based on this review. Evidence Review: A review of the literature for articles reporting studies on and that described concepts related to soft palate reconstruction was conducted in March 2017. In all, 1804 candidate titles and abstracts were independently reviewed. English-language articles that discussed acquired soft palate defect reconstruction were included. Non-English language studies without available translations, studies on primary soft palate defect reconstruction (ie, cleft palate repair) and primary cleft palate repair, studies in which the soft palate was not the focus of the article, and studies involving animals were excluded. Findings: The following observations were made from the review of 92 included articles. Soft palate anatomy is a complex interplay of multiple structures working in a 3-dimensional area. Three of the authors created an initial algorithmic framework based on the selected studies. After this, a round table discussion among 3 authors considered experts was used to refine the algorithm based on their expert opinion. The 4 most important factors were determined to be defect size, defect extension to other subsites, defect thickness, and history of radiotherapy or planned radiotherapy. This algorithm includes both surgical and nonsurgical options. Defects in the soft palate not only affect the size and shape of the organ but, more critically, the function. The reconstructive ladder is used to help maximize the remaining soft palate functional tissue and minimize the effect of nonfunctional implanted tissue. Partial-thickness defects or defects less than one-fourth of the soft palate may not require locoregional tissue transfer. Patients with a history of radiotherapy or defects of up to 75% of the soft palate may require locoregional tissue transfer. Defects greater than 75% of the soft palate, defects that include exposure of the neck vasculature, or defects that include significant portions of the hard palate or adjacent oropharyngeal subsites may require free tissue transfer. Obturation should be considered a second-line option in most cases. Conclusions and Relevance: Ideal reconstruction of the soft palate relies on a comprehensive understanding of soft palate anatomy, a full consideration of the armamentarium of surgical techniques, consideration for adjacent subsite deficits, and a detailed knowledge of various intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors to optimize speech, swallowing, and airway outcomes. The included algorithm may serve as a useful starting point for the surgeon when considering reconstruction."
"Gene expression profiling in blood from cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients living in Senegal. Background: Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major health problem in Africa. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are not fully understood. Transcriptomic studies may provide new insights into molecular pathways involved in the severe form of the disease. Methods: Blood transcriptional levels were assessed in patients with cerebral malaria, non-cerebral malaria, or mild malaria by using microarray technology to look for gene expression profiles associated with clinical status. Multi-way ANOVA was used to extract differentially expressed genes. Network and pathways analyses were used to detect enrichment for biological pathways. Results: We identified a set of 443 genes that were differentially expressed in the three patient groups after applying a false discovery rate of 10%. Since the cerebral patients displayed a particular transcriptional pattern, we focused our analysis on the differences between cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients. We further found 842 differentially expressed genes after applying a false discovery rate of 10%. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of cerebral malaria-informative genes led to clustering of the cerebral malaria patients. The support vector machine method allowed us to correctly classify five out of six cerebral malaria patients and six of six mild malaria patients. Furthermore, the products of the differentially expressed genes were mapped onto a human protein-protein network. This led to the identification of the proteins with the highest number of interactions, including GSK3B, RELA, and APP. The enrichment analysis of the gene functional annotation indicates that genes involved in immune signalling pathways play a role in the occurrence of cerebral malaria. These include BCR-, TCR-, TLR-, cytokine-, FcÎµRI-, and FCGR-signalling pathways and natural killer cell cytotoxicity pathways, which are involved in the activation of immune cells. In addition, our results revealed an enrichment of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions: In the present study, we examine a set of genes whose expression differed in cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients. Moreover, our results provide new insights into the potential effect of the dysregulation of gene expression in immune pathways. Host genetic variation may partly explain such alteration of gene expression. Further studies are required to investigate this in African populations."
"Urinary Metabolomic Markers of Protein Glycation, Oxidation, and Nitration in Early-Stage Decline in Metabolic, Vascular, and Renal Health. Glycation, oxidation, nitration, and crosslinking of proteins are implicated in the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Related modified amino acids formed by proteolysis are excreted in urine. We quantified urinary levels of these metabolites and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in healthy subjects and assessed changes in early-stage decline in metabolic, vascular, and renal health and explored their diagnostic utility for a noninvasive health screen. We recruited 200 human subjects with early-stage health decline and healthy controls. Urinary amino acid metabolites were determined by stable isotopic dilution analysis liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Machine learning was applied to optimise and validate algorithms to discriminate between study groups for potential diagnostic utility. Urinary analyte changes were as follows: impaired metabolic health - increased NÏµ-carboxymethyl-lysine, glucosepane, glutamic semialdehyde, and pyrraline; impaired vascular health - increased glucosepane; and impaired renal health - increased BCAAs and decreased NÏµ-(Î³-glutamyl)lysine. Algorithms combining subject age, BMI, and BCAAs discriminated between healthy controls and impaired metabolic, vascular, and renal health study groups with accuracy of 84%, 72%, and 90%, respectively. In 2-step analysis, algorithms combining subject age, BMI, and urinary NÏµ-fructosyl-lysine and valine discriminated between healthy controls and impaired health (any type), accuracy of 78%, and then between types of health impairment with accuracy of 69%-78% (cf. random selection 33%). From likelihood ratios, this provided small, moderate, and conclusive evidence of early-stage cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disease with diagnostic odds ratios of 6 - 7, 26 - 28, and 34 - 79, respectively. We conclude that measurement of urinary glycated, oxidized, crosslinked, and branched-chain amino acids provides the basis for a noninvasive health screen for early-stage health decline in metabolic, vascular, and renal health."
"Re-formulating Gehan's design as a flexible two-stage single-arm trial. BACKGROUND: Gehan's two-stage design was historically the design of choice for phase II oncology trials. One of the reasons it is less frequently used today is that it does not allow for a formal test of treatment efficacy, and therefore does not control conventional type-I and type-II error-rates. METHODS: We describe how recently developed methodology for flexible two-stage single-arm trials can be used to incorporate the hypothesis test commonly associated with phase II trials in to Gehan's design. We additionally detail how this hypothesis test can be optimised in order to maximise its power, and describe how the second stage sample sizes can be chosen to more readily provide the operating characteristics that were originally envisioned by Gehan. Finally, we contrast our modified Gehan designs to Simon's designs, based on two examples motivated by real clinical trials. RESULTS: Gehan's original designs are often greatly under- or over-powered when compared to type-II error-rates typically used in phase II. However, we demonstrate that the control parameters of his design can be chosen to resolve this problem. With this, though, the modified Gehan designs have operating characteristics similar to the more familiar Simon designs. CONCLUSIONS: The trial design settings in which Gehan's design will be preferable over Simon's designs are likely limited. Provided the second stage sample sizes are chosen carefully, however, one scenario of potential utility is when the trial's primary goal is to ascertain the treatment response rate to a certain precision."
"DeepFHR: intelligent prediction of fetal Acidemia using fetal heart rate signals based on convolutional neural network. BACKGROUND: Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is a screening tool used by obstetricians to evaluate the fetal state. Because of the complexity and non-linearity, a visual interpretation of FHR signals using common guidelines usually results in significant subjective inter-observer and intra-observer variability. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology have recently been developed to assist obstetricians in making objective medical decisions. METHODS: In this work, we present an 8-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to automatically predict fetal acidemia. After signal preprocessing, the input 2-dimensional (2D) images are obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which provides a better way to observe and capture the hidden characteristic information of the FHR signals in both the time and frequency domains. Unlike the conventional machine learning (ML) approaches, this work does not require the execution of complex feature engineering, i.e., feature extraction and selection. In fact, 2D CNN model can self-learn useful features from the input data with the prerequisite of not losing informative features, representing the tremendous advantage of deep learning (DL) over ML. RESULTS: Based on the test open-access database (CTU-UHB), after comprehensive experimentation, we achieved better classification performance using the optimal CNN configuration compared to other state-of-the-art methods: the averaged ten-fold cross-validation of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, quality index defined as the geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity, and the area under the curve yielded results of 98.34, 98.22, 94.87, 96.53 and 97.82%, respectively CONCLUSIONS: Once the proposed CNN model is successfully trained, the corresponding CAD system can be served as an effective tool to predict fetal asphyxia objectively and accurately."
"Discovery of stroke-related blood biomarkers from gene expression network models. Background: Identifying molecular biomarkers characteristic of ischemic stroke has the potential to aid in distinguishing stroke cases from stroke mimicking symptoms, as well as advancing the understanding of the physiological changes that underlie the body's response to stroke. This study uses machine learning-based analysis of gene co-expression to identify transcription patterns characteristic of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: Mutual information values for the expression levels among 13,243 quantified transcripts were computed for blood samples from 82 stroke patients and 68 controls to construct a co-expression network of genes (separately) for stroke and control samples. Page rank centrality scores were computed for every gene; a gene's significance in the network was assessed according to the differences in their network's pagerank centrality between stroke and control expression patterns. A hybrid genetic algorithm - support vector machine learning tool was used to classify samples based on gene centrality in order to identify an optimal set of predictor genes for stroke while minimizing the number of genes in the model. Results: A predictive model with 89.6% accuracy was identified using 6 network-central and differentially expressed genes (ID3, MBTPS1, NOG, SFXN2, BMX, SLC22A1), characterized by large differences in association network connectivity between stroke and control samples. In contrast, classification models based solely on individual genes identified by significant fold-changes in expression level provided lower predictive accuracies: < 71% for any single gene, and even models with larger (10-25) numbers of gene transcript biomarkers gave lower predictive accuracies (â‰¤ 82%) than the 6 network-based gene signature classification. miRNA:mRNA target prediction computational analysis revealed 8 differentially expressed micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that are significantly associated with at least 2 of the 6 network-central genes. Conclusions: Network-based models have the potential to identify a more statistically robust pattern of gene expression typical of acute ischemic stroke and to generate hypotheses about possible interactions among functionally relevant genes, leading to the identification of more informative biomarkers."
"Development and Assessment of a Machine Learning Model to Help Predict Survival among Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Importance: Predicting survival of oral squamous cell carcinoma through the use of prediction modeling has been underused, and the development of prediction models would augment clinicians' ability to provide absolute risk estimates for individual patients. Objectives: To develop a prediction model using machine learning for 5-year overall survival among patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and compare this model with a prediction model created from the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) clinical and pathologic stage. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 33065 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma from the National Cancer Data Base between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011. Patients were excluded if the treatment was considered palliative, staging demonstrated T0 or Tis, or survival or staging data were missing. Patient, tumor, treatment, and outcome information were obtained from the National Cancer Data Base. The data were split into a distribution of 80% for training and 20% for testing. The model was created using 2-class decision forest architecture. Permutation feature importance scores were used to determine the variables that were used in the model's prediction and their order of significance. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 1, 2018, to January 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ability to predict 5-year overall survival assessed through area under the curve, accuracy, precision, and recall. Results: Among the 33065 patients in the study, the mean (SD) age was 64.6 (14.0) years, 19791 were men (59.9%), 13 274 were women (40.1%), and 29783 (90.1%) were white. At 60 months, there were 16745 deaths (50.6%). The median time of follow-up was 56.8 months (range, 0-155.6 months). Age, pathologic T stage, positive margins at the time of surgery, lymph node size, and institutional identification were identified among the most significant variables. The calculated area under the curve for this machine learning model was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.79-0.81), accuracy was 71%, precision was 71%, and recall was 68%. In comparison, the calculated area under the curve of the TNM staging system was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.70), accuracy was 65%, precision was 69%, and recall was 52%. Conclusions and Relevance: Using machine learning algorithms, a prediction model was created based on patient social, demographic, clinical, and pathologic features. The developed prediction model proved to be better than a prediction model that exclusively used TNM pathologic and clinical stage according to all performance metrics. This study highlights the role that machine learning may play in individual patient risk estimation in the era of big data."
"Viral Infections Exacerbate FUS-ALS Phenotypes in iPSC-Derived Spinal Neurons in a Virus Species-Specific Manner. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) arises from an interplay of genetic mutations and environmental factors. ssRNA viruses are possible ALS risk factors, but testing their interaction with mutations such as in FUS, which encodes an RNA-binding protein, has been difficult due to the lack of a human disease model. Here, we use isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived spinal neurons (SNs) to investigate the interaction between ssRNA viruses and mutant FUS. We find that rabies virus (RABV) spreads ALS phenotypes, including the formation of stress granules (SGs) with aberrant composition due to increased levels of FUS protein, as well as neurodegeneration and reduced restriction activity by FUS mutations. Consistent with this, iPSC-derived SNs harboring mutant FUS are more sensitive to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Zika viruses (ZIKV). We demonstrate that RABV and HIV-1 exacerbate cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS. Our results demonstrate that viral infections worsen ALS pathology in SNs with genetic risk factors, suggesting a novel role for viruses in modulating patient phenotypes."
"The road map of cancer precision medicine with the innovation of advanced cancer detection technology and personalized immunotherapy. The advancement of cancer genomics research due to the development of next generation sequencing technologies is going to bring the promise of cancer precision medicine, in turn revolutionizing cancer detection and treatment. In this review, we will discuss the possible road map for implementation of cancer precision medicine into the clinical practice by mainly focusing on the role of liquid biopsy, particularly circulating tumor DNA, as a potential tool for cancer screening, selection of an appropriate drug(s), surveillance of minimal residual diseases, and early detection of recurrence. We will also review the current status of genome-driven oncology and emerging field of immunotherapies that could be provided to patients to improve their clinical outcome and quality of life. Lastly, we will discuss the usefulness of artificial intelligence that facilitate complex data integration in our health care/medical care system."
A Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Response to Therapy in Cancer. Sakellaropoulos et al. designed a machine learning workflow to predict drug response and survival of cancer patients. All pipelines are trained on a large panel of cancer cell lines and tested in clinical cohorts. DNN outperforms other machine learning algorithms by capturing pathways that link gene expression with drug response.
"Anchoring of actin to the plasma membrane enables tension production in the fission yeast cytokinetic ring. The cytokinetic ring generates tensile force that drives cell division, but how tension emerges from the relatively disordered ring organization remains unclear. Long ago, a musclelike sliding filament mechanism was proposed, but evidence for sarcomeric order is lacking. Here we present quantitative evidence that in fission yeast, ring tension originates from barbed-end anchoring of actin filaments to the plasma membrane, providing resistance to myosin forces that enables filaments to develop tension. The role of anchoring was highlighted by experiments on isolated fission yeast rings, where sections of ring became unanchored from the membrane and shortened âˆ¼30-fold faster than normal. The dramatically elevated constriction rates are unexplained. Here we present a molecularly explicit simulation of constricting partially anchored rings as studied in these experiments. Simulations accurately reproduced the experimental constriction rates and showed that following anchor release, a segment becomes tensionless and shortens via a novel noncontractile reeling-in mechanism at about the velocity of load-free myosin II. The ends are reeled in by barbed endâ€“anchored actin filaments in adjacent segments. Other actin anchoring schemes failed to constrict rings. Our results quantitatively support a specific organization and anchoring scheme that generate tension in the cytokinetic ring."
"Development and evaluation of a computable phenotype to identify pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma treated with chemotherapy using electronic health record data. Background: Widespread implementation of electronic health records (EHR) has created new opportunities for pediatric oncology observational research. Little attention has been given to using EHR data to identify patients with pediatric hematologic malignancies. Methods: This study used EHR-derived data in a pediatric clinical data research network, PEDSnet, to develop and evaluate a computable phenotype algorithm to identify pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma who received treatment with chemotherapy. To guide early development, multiple computable phenotype-defined cohorts were compared to one institution's tumor registry. The most promising algorithm was chosen for formal evaluation and consisted of at least two leukemia/lymphoma diagnoses (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine codes) within a 90-day period, two chemotherapy exposures, and three hematology-oncology provider encounters. During evaluation, the computable phenotype was executed against EHR data from 2011 to 2016 at three large institutions. Classification accuracy was assessed by masked medical record review with phenotype-identified patients compared to a control group with at least three hematology-oncology encounters. Results: The computable phenotype had sensitivity of 100% (confidence interval [CI] 99%, 100%), specificity of 99% (CI 99%, 100%), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, and C-statistic of 1 at the development institution. The computable phenotype performance was similar at the two test institutions with sensitivity of 100% (CI 99%, 100%), specificity of 99% (CI 99%, 100%), PPV of 96%, NPV of 100%, and C-statistic of 0.99. Conclusion: The EHR-based computable phenotype is an accurate cohort identification tool for pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma who have been treated with chemotherapy and is ready for use in clinical studies."
"Assessment of Deep Natural Language Processing in Ascertaining Oncologic Outcomes From Radiology Reports. Importance: A rapid learning health care system for oncology will require scalable methods for extracting clinical end points from electronic health records (EHRs). Outside of clinical trials, end points such as cancer progression and response are not routinely encoded into structured data. Objective: To determine whether deep natural language processing can extract relevant cancer outcomes from radiologic reports, a ubiquitous but unstructured EHR data source. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study evaluated 1112 patients who underwent tumor genotyping for a diagnosis of lung cancer and participated in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute PROFILE study from June 26, 2013, to July 2, 2018. Exposures: Patients were divided into curation and reserve sets. Human abstractors applied a structured framework to radiologic reports for the curation set to ascertain the presence of cancer and changes in cancer status over time (ie, worsening/progressing vs improving/responding). Deep learning models were then trained to capture these outcomes from report text and subsequently evaluated in a 10% held-out test subset of curation patients. Cox proportional hazards regression models compared human and machine curations of disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and time to improvement/response in the curation set, and measured associations between report classification and overall survival in the curation and reserve sets. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for deep learning models; secondary outcomes were time to improvement/response, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: A total of 2406 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [10.8] years; 1428 female [59.7%]; 2170 [90.2%] white). Radiologic reports (n = 14230) were manually reviewed for 1112 patients in the curation set. In the test subset (n = 109), deep learning models identified the presence of cancer, improvement/response, and worsening/progression with accurate discrimination (AUC >0.90). Machine and human curation yielded similar measurements of disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] for machine vs human curation, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.71-1.95); progression-free survival (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71-1.71); and time to improvement/response (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.65-1.64). Among 15000 additional reports for 1294 reserve set patients, algorithm-detected cancer worsening/progression was associated with decreased overall survival (HR for mortality, 4.04; 95% CI, 2.78-5.85), and improvement/response was associated with increased overall survival (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.77). Conclusions and Relevance: Deep natural language processing appears to speed curation of relevant cancer outcomes and facilitate rapid learning from EHR data."
"A temporal visualization of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression using deep learning and unstructured clinical notes. BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that is classified into stages based on disease severity. We aimed to characterize the time to progression prior to death in patients with COPD and to generate a temporal visualization that describes signs and symptoms during different stages of COPD progression. METHODS: We present a two-step approach for visualizing COPD progression at the level of unstructured clinical notes. We included 15,500 COPD patients who both received care within Partners Healthcare's network and died between 2011 and 2017. We first propose a four-layer deep learning model that utilizes a specially configured recurrent neural network to capture irregular time lapse segments. Using those irregular time lapse segments, we created a temporal visualization (the COPD atlas) to demonstrate COPD progression, which consisted of representative sentences at each time window prior to death based on a fraction of theme words produced by a latent Dirichlet allocation model. We evaluated our approach on an annotated corpus of COPD patients' unstructured pulmonary, radiology, and cardiology notes. RESULTS: Experiments compared to the baselines showed that our proposed approach improved interpretability as well as the accuracy of estimating COPD progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed deep-learning approach to handling temporal variation in COPD progression is feasible and can be used to generate a graphical representation of disease progression using information extracted from clinical notes."
"miR-22-5p and miR-29a-5p Are Reliable Reference Genes for Analyzing Extracellular Vesicle-Associated miRNAs in Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Are Stable under Inflammatory Priming Mimicking Osteoarthritis Condition. During the last two decades, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) gained a place of privilege in the field of regenerative medicine. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as major mediators of MSCs immunosuppressive as well as pro-regenerative activities in many disease models, including inflammatory/degenerative conditions as joint diseases and osteoarthritis. In order to shed light on EVs potential, a rigorous profiling of embedded proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (mRNA/miRNA) is mandatory. Nevertheless, reliable strategies to efficiently score miRNA cargo and modulation under diverse experimental conditions or treatments are missing. The aim of this work was to identify reliable reference genes (RGs) to analyze miRNA content in EVs secreted by adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) and verify their consistency under inflammatory conditions that were proposed to enhance ASC-EVs immunomodulatory and regenerative potential. RefFinder algorithm, that integrates the currently available major computational programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct method), allowed to identify miR-22-5p and miR-29a-5p as the most stable RGs. Notably, both miRNAs maintained the highest stability when EVs isolated from IFNg-treated ASCs were included in the analysis. In addition, considerable effects of suboptimal RGs choice on the reliable quantification of miRNAs involved at different levels (tissue homeostasis or macrophage polarization) in the osteoarthritis phenotype, and thus considered as promising therapeutic molecule, have clearly been demonstrated. In conclusion, a proper normalization method is not only needed for research purposes but also mandatory to characterize clinical products and predict their therapeutic potential, especially in the emerging field of MSCs derived-EVs as new tools for regenerative medicine."
"Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy versus endometrial ablation for women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HEALTH): a parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial. Background: Heavy menstrual bleeding affects 25% of women in the UK, many of whom require surgery to treat it. Hysterectomy is effective but has more complications than endometrial ablation, which is less invasive but ultimately leads to hysterectomy in 20% of women. We compared laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with endometrial ablation in women seeking surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Methods: In this parallel-group, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 31 hospitals in the UK, women younger than 50 years who were referred to a gynaecologist for surgical treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and who were eligible for endometrial ablation were randomly allocated (1:1) to either laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy or second generation endometrial ablation. Women were randomly assigned by either an interactive voice response telephone system or an internet-based application with a minimisation algorithm based on centre and age group (<40 years vs â‰¥40 years). Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy involves laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery to remove the upper part of the uterus (the body) containing the endometrium. Endometrial ablation aims to treat heavy menstrual bleeding by destroying the endometrium, which is responsible for heavy periods. The co-primary clinical outcomes were patient satisfaction and condition-specific quality of life, measured with the menorrhagia multi-attribute quality of life scale (MMAS), assessed at 15 months after randomisation. Our analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49013893. Findings: Between May 21, 2014, and March 28, 2017, we enrolled and randomly assigned 660 women (330 in each group). 616 (93%) of 660 women were operated on within the study period, 588 (95%) of whom received the allocated procedure and 28 (5%) of whom had an alternative surgery. At 15 months after randomisation, more women allocated to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were satisfied with their operation compared with those in the endometrial ablation group (270 [97%] of 278 women vs 244 [87%] of 280 women; adjusted percentage difference 9Â·8, 95% CI 5Â·1â€“14Â·5; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2Â·53, 95% CI 1Â·83â€“3Â·48; p<0Â·0001). Women randomly assigned to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were also more likely to have the best possible MMAS score of 100 than women assigned to endometrial ablation (180 [69%] of 262 women vs 146 [54%] of 268 women; adjusted percentage difference 13Â·3, 95% CI 3Â·8â€“22Â·8; adjusted OR 1Â·87, 95% CI 1Â·31â€“2Â·67; p=0Â·00058). 14 (5%) of 309 women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group and 11 (4%) of 307 women in the endometrial ablation group had at least one serious adverse event (adjusted OR 1Â·30, 95% CI 0Â·56â€“3Â·02; p=0Â·54). Interpretation: Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is superior to endometrial ablation in terms of clinical effectiveness and has a similar proportion of complications, but takes longer to perform and is associated with a longer recovery.

"Automated classification of dense calcium tissues in gray-scale intravascular ultrasound images using a deep belief network. BACKGROUND: IVUS is widely used to quantitatively assess coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to automatically characterize dense calcium (DC) tissue in the gray scale intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images using the image textural features. METHODS: A total of 316â€‰Gy-scale IVUS and corresponding virtual histology images from 26 patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent IVUS along with X-ray angiography between October 2009 to September 2014 were retrospectively acquired and analyzed. One expert performed all procedures and assessed their IVUS scans. After image acquisition, the DC candidate and corresponding acoustic shadow regions were automatically determined. Then, nine image-base feature groups were extracted from the DC candidates. In order to reduce the dimensionalities, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, and selected feature sets were utilized as an input for a deep belief network. Classification results were validated using 10-fold cross validation. RESULTS: The dimensionality of the feature map was efficiently reduced by 50% (from 66 to 33) without any performance decrease using PCA method. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the proposed method were 92.8â€‰Â±â€‰0.1%, 85.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.1%, and 88.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.1%, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). We found that the window size could largely influence the characterization results, and selected the 5â€‰Ã—â€‰5 size as the best condition. We also validated the performance superiority of the proposed method with traditional classification methods. CONCLUSIONS: These experimental results suggest that the proposed method has significant clinical applicability for IVUS-based cardiovascular diagnosis."
"Meta-Analysis Reveals Reproducible Gut Microbiome Alterations in Response to a High-Fat Diet. Multiple research groups have shown that diet impacts the gut microbiome; however, variability in experimental design and quantitative assessment have made it challenging to assess the degree to which similar diets have reproducible effects across studies. Through an unbiased subject-level meta-analysis framework, we re-analyzed 27 dietary studies including 1,101 samples from rodents and humans. We demonstrate that a high-fat diet (HFD) reproducibly changes gut microbial community structure. Finer taxonomic analysis revealed that the most reproducible signals of a HFD are Lactococcus species, which we experimentally demonstrate to be common dietary contaminants. Additionally, a machine-learning approach defined a signature that predicts the dietary intake of mice and demonstrated that phylogenetic and gene-centric transformations of this model can be translated to humans. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of microbiome meta-analyses in identifying robust and reproducible features for mechanistic studies in preclinical models."
"Flavokawain B targets protein neddylation for enhancing the anti-prostate cancer effect of Bortezomib via Skp2 degradation. Background: Flavokawain B (FKB) has been identified from kava root extracts as a potent apoptosis inducer for inhibiting the growth of various cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer. However, the molecular targets of FKB in prostate cancer cells remain unknown. Methods: An in vitro NEDD8 Initiation Conjugation Assay was used to evaluate the neddylation inhibitory activity of FKB. Molecular docking and a cellular thermal shift assay were performed to assess the direct interaction between FKB and the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) complex. Protein neddylation, ubiqutination, stability and expression in cells were assessed with immunoprecipitation and Western blotting methods using specific antibodies. Deletion and site specific mutants and siRNAs were used to evaluate deep mechanisms by which FKB induces Skp2 degradation. Cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction were measured by MTT, ELISA and Western blotting methods. Results: FKB inhibits NEDD8 conjugations to both Cullin1 and Ubc12 in prostate cancer cell lines and Ubc12 neddylation in an in vitro assay. Molecular docking study and a cellular thermal shift assay reveal that FKB interacts with the regulatory subunit (i.e. APP-BP1) of the NAE. In addition, FKB causes Skp2 degradation in an ubiquitin and proteasome dependent manner. Overexpression of dominant-negative cullin1 (1-452), K720R mutant (the neddylation site) Cullin1 or the F-box deleted Skp2 that losses its binding to the Skp1/Cullin1 complex causes the resistance to FKB-induced Skp2 degradation, whereas siRNA knock-down of Cdh1, a known E3 ligase of Skp2 for targeted degradation, didn't attenuate the effect of FKB on Skp2 degradation. These results suggest that degradation of Skp2 by FKB is involved in a functional Cullin1. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors Bortezomib and MG132 transcriptionally down-regulate the expression of Skp2, and their combinations with FKB result in enhanced inhibitory effects on the growth of prostate cancer cell lines via synergistic down-regulation of Skp2 and up-regulation of p27/Kip1 and p21/WAF1 protein expression. FKB also selectively inhibits the growth of RB deficient cells with high expression of Skp2. Conclusion: These findings provide a rationale for further investigating combination of FKB and Bortezomib for treatment of RB deficient, castration-resistant prostate cancer."
"Parsing clinical text using the state-of-the-art deep learning based parsers: a systematic comparison. BACKGROUND: A shareable repository of clinical notes is critical for advancing natural language processing (NLP) research, and therefore a goal of many NLP researchers is to create a shareable repository of clinical notes, that has breadth (from multiple institutions) as well as depth (as much individual data as possible). METHODS: We aimed to assess the degree to which individuals would be willing to contribute their health data to such a repository. A compact e-survey probed willingness to share demographic and clinical data categories. Participants were faculty, staff, and students in two geographically diverse major medical centers (Utah and New York). Such a sample could be expected to respond like a typical potential participant from the general public who is given complete and fully informed consent about the pros and cons of participating in a research study. RESULTS: 2140 respondents completed the surveys. 56% of respondents were ""somewhat/definitely willing"" to share clinical data with identifiers, while 89% of respondents were ""somewhat (17%) /definitely willing (72%)"" to share without identifiers. Results were consistent across gender, age, and education, but there were some differences by geographical region. Individuals were most reluctant (50-74%) sharing mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence data. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a substantial fraction of potential patient participants, once educated about risks and benefits, would be willing to donate de-identified clinical data to a shared research repository. A slight majority even would be willing to share absent de-identification, suggesting that perceptions about data misuse are not a major concern. Such a repository of clinical notes should be invaluable for clinical NLP research and advancement."
"Identification of Cancer-associated metabolic vulnerabilities by modeling multi-objective optimality in metabolism. Background: Cancer cells undergo global reprogramming of cellular metabolism to satisfy demands of energy and biomass during proliferation and metastasis. Computational modeling of genome-scale metabolic models is an effective approach for designing new therapeutics targeting dysregulated cancer metabolism by identifying metabolic enzymes crucial for satisfying metabolic goals of cancer cells, but nearly all previous studies neglect the existence of metabolic demands other than biomass synthesis and trade-offs between these contradicting metabolic demands. It is thus necessary to develop computational models covering multiple metabolic objectives to study cancer metabolism and identify novel metabolic targets. Methods: We developed a multi-objective optimization model for cancer cell metabolism at genome-scale and an integrated, data-driven workflow for analyzing the Pareto optimality of this model in achieving multiple metabolic goals and identifying metabolic enzymes crucial for maintaining cancer-associated metabolic phenotypes. Using this workflow, we constructed cell line-specific models for a panel of cancer cell lines and identified lists of metabolic targets promoting or suppressing cancer cell proliferation or the Warburg Effect. The targets were then validated using knockdown and over-expression experiments in cultured cancer cell lines. Results: We found that the multi-objective optimization model correctly predicted phenotypes including cell growth rates, essentiality of metabolic genes and cell line specific sensitivities to metabolic perturbations. To our surprise, metabolic enzymes promoting proliferation substantially overlapped with those suppressing the Warburg Effect, suggesting that simply targeting the overlapping enzymes may lead to complicated outcomes. We also identified lists of metabolic enzymes important for maintaining rapid proliferation or high Warburg Effect while having little effect on the other. The importance of these enzymes in cancer metabolism predicted by the model was validated by their association with cancer patient survival and knockdown and overexpression experiments in a variety of cancer cell lines. Conclusions: These results confirm this multi-objective optimization model as a novel and effective approach for studying trade-off between metabolic demands of cancer cells and identifying cancer-associated metabolic vulnerabilities, and suggest novel metabolic targets for cancer treatment.

"Virtual screening of naphthoquinone analogs for potent inhibitors against the cancer-signaling PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the most commonly disrupted signaling pathways that plays a role in the development and pathogenicity of multiple cancers. Therefore, the critical proteins of this pathway have been targeted for anticancer therapy. The scientific community has increasingly been realizing the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of naphthoquinone analogs. These compounds constitute a major class of diverse sets of plant metabolites, which include various natural products and synthetic compounds with proven anticancer activity. The current study involved structural computational biology approaches to explore compounds from a diverse pool of naphthoquinone analogs that can inhibit key cancer-signaling proteins phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B, PKB (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The novel compound identified commonly among the top 10 dock score lists of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was selected for further study and proposed as a potential inhibitor of the 3 cancer-signaling proteins and an anticancer agent. Further, to check the docking accuracy and potential of the compound, post docking analyses, namely, binding comparison with the native ligand, the role of the interacting residue role in binding, predicted binding energy and dissociation constant calculations, etc., were performed. All these measures showed good-quality binding, and thus provide weight to our prediction of the novel compound as a pan PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor and an anticancer agent. Finally, to compare the binding and similarity in the active sites of the 3 protein kinases, a ligand-based active site alignment was performed and analyzed. Thus, the study proposed a novel naphthoquinone analog as a potential anticancer drug, and provided comparative structural insight into its binding to the 3 protein kinases."
"In silico evidence of de novo interactions between ribosomal and Epstein - Barr virus proteins. Background: Association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent gene products with host ribosomal proteins (RPs) has not been fully explored, despite their involvement in the aetiology of several human cancers. To gain an insight into their plausible interactions, we employed a computational approach that encompasses structural alignment, gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis, and molecular docking. Results: In this study, the alignment analysis based on structural similarity allows the prediction of 48 potential interactions between 27 human RPs and the EBV proteins EBNA1, LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B. Gene ontology analysis of the putative protein-protein interactions (PPIs) reveals their probable involvement in RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, metabolic and biosynthetic processes, and gene regulation. Pathway analysis shows their possible participation in viral infection strategies (viral translation), as well as oncogenesis (Wnt and EGFR signalling pathways). Finally, our molecular docking assay predicts the functional interactions of EBNA1 with four RPs individually: EBNA1-eS10, EBNA1-eS25, EBNA1-uL10 and EBNA1-uL11. Conclusion: These interactions have never been revealed previously via either experimental or in silico approach. We envisage that the calculated interactions between the ribosomal and EBV proteins herein would provide a hypothetical model for future experimental studies on the functional relationship between ribosomal proteins and EBV infection."
"Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside alleviates palmitic acid-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by regulating miR-129-3p/Smad3 signaling. Objective: Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) has been reported to exert a cytoprotective effect against various toxicants. However, the function and mechanism of TSG in palmitic acid (PA)-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes are still unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the post-transcriptional mechanism in TSG-treated cardiomyocytesâ€™ inflammation and apoptosis induced by PA. Methods: The mRNA and protein levels were assayed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The targeted genes were predicted by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/polyimide (annexin V-FITC/PI) staining was used to evaluate apoptosis using flow cytometry. Results: TSG restricted the detrimental effects, including the activated inflammatory response and apoptosis, of PA in cardiomyocytes, as well as the up-regulation of miR-129-3p and down-regulation of p-Smad3 expression. In addition, bioinformatics and experimental analysis suggested that Smad3 was a direct target of miR-129-3p, which could inhibit or enhance the expression of p-Smad by transfection with miR-129-3p mimics or inhibitors, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that overexpression of Smad3 reversed the inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis by overexpression of miR-129-3p in PA-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Conclusion: TSG targeted to miR-129-3p/Smad3 signaling inhibited PA-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes."
"Investigation of deleterious effects of nsSNPs in the POT1 gene: a structural genomics-based approach to understand the mechanism of cancer development. Protection of telomere 1 (POT1) is one of the key components of shelterin complex, implicated in maintaining the telomere homeostasis, and thus stability of the eukaryotic genome. A large number of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the POT1 gene have been reported to cause varieties of human diseases, including cancer. In recent years, a number of mutations in POT1 has been markedly increased, and interpreting the effect of these large numbers of mutations to understand the mechanism of associated diseases seems impossible using experimental approaches. Herein, we employ varieties of computational methods such as PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, PoPMuSiC, SDM2, STRUM, and MAESTRO to identify the effects of 387 nsSNPs on the structure and function of POT1 protein. We have identified about 183 nsSNPs as deleterious and termed them as â€œhigh-confidence nsSNPs.â€ Distribution of these high-confidence nsSNPs demonstrates that the mutation in oligonucleotide binding domain 1 is highly deleterious (one in every three nsSNPs), and high-confidence nsSNPs show a strong correlation with residue conservation. The structure analysis provides a detailed insights into the structural changes occurred in consequence of conserved mutations which lead to the cancer progression. This study, for the first time, offers a newer prospective on the role of POT1 mutations on the structure, function, and their relation to associated diseases."
"Theaflavin-3,3Â´-digallate increases the antibacterial activity of Î²-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting metallo-Î²-lactamase activity. Metallo-Î²-lactamases (MBLs) are some of the best known Î²-lactamases produced by common Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and are crucial factors in the rise of bacterial resistance against Î²-lactam antibiotics. Although many types of Î²-lactamase inhibitors have been successfully developed and used in clinical settings, no MBL inhibitors have been identified to date. Nitrocefin, checkerboard and time-kill assays were used to examine the enzyme behaviour in vitro. Molecular docking calculation, molecular dynamics simulation, calculation of the binding free energy and ligand-residue interaction decomposition were used for mechanistic research. The behaviour of the enzymes in vivo was investigated by a mouse infection experiment. We showed that theaflavin-3,3Â´-digallate (TFDG), a natural compound lacking antibacterial activities, can inhibit the hydrolysis of MBLs. In the checkerboard and time-kill assays, we observed a synergistic effect of TFDG with Î²-lactam antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus BAA1717. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify the mechanism of the inhibition of MBLs by TFDG, and we observed that the hydrolysis activity of the MBLs was restricted by the binding of TFDG to Gln242 and Ser369. Furthermore, the combination of TFDG with Î²-lactam antibiotics showed effective protection in a mouse Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia model. These findings suggest that TFDG can effectively inhibit the hydrolysis activity of MBLs and enhance the antibacterial activity of Î²-lactam antibiotics against pathogens in vitro and in vivo."
"Phthalides serve as potent modulators to boost fetal hemoglobin induction therapy for Î²-hemoglobinopathies. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction therapy has become the most promising strategy for treating Î²-hemoglobinopathies, including sickle-cell diseases and Î²-thalassemia. However, subtle but critical structural difference exists between HbF and normal adult hemoglobin (HbA), which inevitably leads to reduced binding of the endogenous modulator 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to HbF and thus increased oxygen affinity and decreased oxygen transport efficiency of HbF. We combined the oxygen equilibrium experiments, resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy, and molecular docking modeling, and we discuss 2 phthalides, z-butylidenephthalide and z-ligustilide, that can effectively lower the oxygen affinity of HbF. They adjust it to a level closer to that of HbA and make it a more satisfactory oxygen carrier for adults. From the oxygen equilibrium curve measurements, we show that the 2 phthalides are more effective than 2,3-BPG for modulating HbF. The RR spectra show that phthalides allosterically stabilize the oxygenated HbF in the low oxygen affinity conformation, and the molecular docking modeling reveals that the 2 chosen phthalides interact with HbF via the cleft around the Î³1/Î³2 interface with a binding strength ;1.6 times stronger than that of 2,3-BPG. We discuss the implications of z-butylidenephthalide and z-ligustilide in boosting the efficacy of HbF induction therapy to mitigate the clinical severities of Î²-hemoglobinopathies."
"Reproducibility and intercorrelation of graph theoretical measures in structural brain connectivity networks. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can be used to non-invasively probe the brain microstructure. In addition, recent advances have enabled the identification of complex fiber configurations present in most of the white matter. This has improved the investigation of structural connectivity with tractography methods. Whole-brain structural connectivity networks, or connectomes, are reconstructed by parcellating the gray matter and performing tractography to determine connectivity between these regions. These complex networks can be analyzed with graph theoretical methods, which measure their global and local properties. However, as these tools have only recently been applied to structural brain networks, there is little information about the reproducibility and intercorrelation of network properties, connectivity weights and fiber tractography reconstruction parameters in the brain. We studied the reproducibility and correlation in structural brain connectivity networks reconstructed with constrained spherical deconvolution based probabilistic streamlines tractography. Diffusion-weighted data from 19 subjects were acquired with b = 2800s/mm(2) and 75 gradient orientations. Intrasubject variability was computed with residual bootstrapping. Our findings indicate that the reproducibility of graph theoretical metrics is generally excellent with the exception of betweenness centrality. A reconstruction density of approximately one million streamlines is necessary for excellent reproducibility, but the reproducibility increases further with higher densities. The reproducibility decreases, but only slightly, when switching to a higher order in constrained spherical deconvolution. Moreover, in binary networks, using sufficiently high threshold values improves the reproducibility. We show that multiple network properties and connectivity weights are highly intercorrelated. The experiments were replicated by using a test-retest dataset of 44 healthy subjects provided by the Human Connectome Project. In conclusion, our results provide guidelines for reproducible investigation of structural brain networks."
"Molecular docking studies of chloroquine and its derivatives against P23pro-zbd domain of chikungunya virus: Implication in designing of novel therapeutic strategies. The arthropod-transmitted chikungunya virus has emerged as an epidemic menace that causes debilitating polyarthritis. With this life-threatening impact on humans, the possible treatment requires to cure the viral infectivity. But, devoid of any vaccine against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), there is a need to develop a novel chemotherapeutic strategy to treat this noxious infection. CHIKV carries highly compact P23pro-zbd structure that possesses potential RNA-binding surface domains which extremely influences the use of RNA template during genome replication at the time of infection and pathogenesis. Therefore, computational approaches were used to explore the novel small molecule inhibitors targeting P23pro-zbd domain. The tertiary structure was modeled and optimized using in silico approaches. The results obtained from PROCHECK (93.1% residues in favored regions), ERRAT (87.480 overall model quality) and ProSA (Z-score: âˆ’11.72) revealed the reliability of the proposed model. Interestingly, a previously reported inhibitor, chloroquine possesses good binding affinities with the target domain. In-depth analysis revealed that chloroquine derivatives such as didesethyl chloroquine hydroxyacetamide, cletoquine, hydroxychloroquine exhibited a better binding affinity. Notably, MD simulation analysis exhibited that Thr1312, Ala1355, Ala1356, Asn1357, Asp1364, Val1366, Cys1367, Ala1401, Gly1403, Ser1443, Tyr1444, Gly1445, Asn1459, and Thr1463 residues are the key amino acid responsible for stable ligand-protein interaction. The results obtained from this study provide new insights and advances the understanding to develop a new approach to consider effective and novel drug against chikungunya. However, a detailed in vivo study is required to explore its drug likeliness against this life-threatening disease."
"Sequencing-based methods and resources to study antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance extracts high morbidity, mortality and economic costs yearly by rendering bacteria immune to antibiotics. Identifying and understanding antimicrobial resistance are imperative for clinical practice to treat resistant infections and for public health efforts to limit the spread of resistance. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing are expanding our abilities to detect and study antimicrobial resistance. This Review provides a detailed overview of antimicrobial resistance identification and characterization methods, from traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing to recent deep-learning methods. We focus on sequencing-based resistance discovery and discuss tools and databases used in antimicrobial resistance studies."
"Validation of the United Kingdom copy-number alteration classifier in 3239 children with B-cell precursor ALL. Genetic abnormalities provide vital diagnostic and prognostic information in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are increasingly used to assign patients to risk groups. We recently proposed a novel classifier based on the copy-number alteration (CNA) profile of the 8 most commonly deleted genes in B-cell precursor ALL. This classifier defined 3 CNA subgroups in consecutive UK trials and was able to discriminate patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In this study, we sought to validate the United Kingdom ALL (UKALL)â€“CNA classifier and reevaluate the interaction with cytogenetic risk groups using individual patient data from 3239 cases collected from 12 groups within the International BFM Study Group. The classifier was validated and defined 3 risk groups with distinct event-free survival (EFS) rates: good (88%), intermediate (76%), and poor (68%) (P, .001). There was no evidence of heterogeneity, even within trials that used minimal residual disease to guide therapy. By integrating CNA and cytogenetic data, we replicated our original key observation that patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics can be stratified into 2 prognostic subgroups. Group A had an EFS rate of 86% (similar to patients with good-risk cytogenetics), while group B patients had a significantly inferior rate (73%, P, .001). Finally, we revised the overall genetic classification by defining 4 risk groups with distinct EFS rates: very good (91%), good (81%), intermediate (73%), and poor (54%), P, .001. In conclusion, the UKALL-CNA classifier is a robust prognostic tool that can be deployed in different trial settings and used to refine established cytogenetic risk groups."
"Identification of a gene set associated with colorectal cancer in microarray data using the entropy method. Objective: We sought to apply Shannonâ€™s entropy to determine colorectal cancer genes in a microarray dataset. Materials and Methods: In the retrospective study, 36 samples were analysed, 18 colorectal carcinoma and 18 paired normal tissue samples. After identification of the gene fold-changes, we used the entropy theory to identify an effective gene set. These genes were subsequently categorised into homogenous clusters. Results: We assessed 36 tissue samples. The entropy theory was used to select a set of 29 genes from 3128 genes that had fold-changes greater than one, which provided the most information on colorectal cancer. This study shows that all genes fall into a cluster, except for the R08183 gene. Conclusion: This study has identified several genes associated with colon cancer using the entropy method, which were not detected by custom methods. Therefore, we suggest that the entropy theory should be used to identify genes associated with cancers in a microarray dataset."
"Bioprospection of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals suggests rutaecarpine and quinine as promising 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors. 15-Lipoxygenase (15-LOX) belongs to the family of nonheme iron containing enzymes that catalyzes the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to generate eicosanoids that play an important role in signaling pathways. The role of 15-LOX has been demonstrated in atherosclerosis as well as other inflammatory diseases. In the present study, drug-like compounds were first screened from a set of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals based on Lipinski's rule of five (ROF) and in silico toxicity filters. Two lead compounds-quinine (QUIN) and rutaecarpine (RUT) were shortlisted by analyzing molecular interactions and binding energies of the filtered compounds with the target using molecular docking. Molecular dynamics simulation studies indicate stable trajectories of apo_15-LOX and docked complexes (15-LOX_QUIN and 15-LOX_RUT). In vitro 15-LOX inhibition studies shows that both QUIN and RUT have lower inhibitory concentration (IC50) value than the control (quercetin). Both QUIN and RUT exhibit moderate antioxidant activities. The cell viability study of these compounds suggests no significant toxicity in HEK-293 cell lines. Further, QUIN and RUT both did not show any inhibition against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. Thus, based on our present findings, rutaecarpine and quinine may be suggested as promising 15-LOX inhibitor for the prevention of the atherosclerosis development."
"Quality of Reporting on Guideline, Protocol, or Algorithm Implementation in Adult Trauma Centers: A Systematic Review. OBJECTIVE: To appraise the quality of reporting on guideline, protocol, and algorithm implementations in adult trauma settings according to the Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE 2.0). BACKGROUND: At present we do not know if published reports of guideline implementations in trauma settings are of sufficient quality to facilitate replication by other centers wishing to implement the same or similar guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Articles were identified through electronic databases and hand searching relevant trauma journals. Studies meeting inclusion criteria focused on a guideline, protocol, or algorithm that targeted adult trauma patients >/=18 years and/or trauma patient care providers, and evaluated the effectiveness of guideline, protocol, or algorithm implementation in terms of change in clinical practice or patient outcomes. Each included study was assessed in duplicate for adherence to the 18-item SQUIRE 2.0 criteria. The primary endpoint was the proportion of studies meeting at least 80% (score >/=15) of SQUIRE 2.0. RESULTS: Of 7368 screened studies, 74 met inclusion criteria. Thirty-nine percent of studies scored >/=80% on SQUIRE 2.0. Criteria that were met most frequently were abstract (93%), problem description (93%), and specific aims (89%). The lowest scores appeared in the funding (28%), context (47%), and results (54%) criteria. No study indicated using SQUIRE 2.0 as a guideline to writing the report. CONCLUSIONS: Significant opportunity exists to improve the utility of guideline implementation reports in adult trauma settings, particularly in the domains of study context and the implications of context for study outcomes."
"Development and validation of an automated HIV prediction algorithm to identify candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis: a modelling study. BACKGROUND: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective but underused, in part because clinicians do not have the tools to identify PrEP candidates. We developed and validated an automated prediction algorithm that uses electronic health record (EHR) data to identify individuals at increased risk for HIV acquisition. METHODS: We used machine learning algorithms to predict incident HIV infections with 180 potential predictors of HIV risk drawn from EHR data from 2007-15 at Atrius Health, an ambulatory group practice in Massachusetts, USA. We included EHRs of all patients aged 15 years or older with at least one clinical encounter during 2007-15. We used ten-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (cv-AUC) with 95% CIs to assess the model's performance at identifying individuals with incident HIV and patients independently prescribed PrEP by clinicians. The best-performing model was validated prospectively with 2016 data from Atrius Health and externally with 2011-16 data from Fenway Health, a community health centre specialising in sexual health care in Boston (MA, USA). We calculated HIV risk scores (ie, probability of an incident HIV diagnosis) for every HIV-uninfected patient not on PrEP during 2007-15 at Atrius Health and assessed the distribution of scores for thresholds to determine possible candidates for PrEP in the three study cohorts. FINDINGS: We included 1 155 966 Atrius Health patients from 2007-15 (150 [<0.1%] patients with incident HIV) in our development cohort, 537 257 Atrius Health patients in 2016 (16 [<0.1%] with incident HIV) in our prospective validation cohort, and 33 404 Fenway Health patients from 2011-16 (423 [1.3%] with incident HIV) in our external validation cohort. The best-performing algorithm was obtained with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and had a cv-AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90) for identification of incident HIV infections in the development cohort, 0.91 (0.81-1.00) on prospective validation, and 0.77 (0.74-0.79) on external validation. The LASSO model successfully identified patients independently prescribed PrEP by clinicians at Atrius Health in 2016 (cv-AUC 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.96) or Fenway Health (0.79, 0.78-0.80). HIV risk scores increased steeply at the 98th percentile. Using this score as a threshold, we prospectively identified 9515 (1.8%) of 536 384 patients at Atrius Health in 2016 and 4385 (15.3%) of 28 702 Fenway Health patients as potential PrEP candidates. INTERPRETATION: Automated algorithms can efficiently identify patients at increased risk for HIV acquisition. Integrating these models into EHRs to alert providers about patients who might benefit from PrEP could improve prescribing and prevent new HIV infections.

"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitory activities of ursane-type triterpenes from Chinese raspberry, fruits of Rubus chingii. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has led to an intense interest in developing its inhibitors as anti-diabetes, anti-obesity and anti-cancer agents. The fruits of Rubus chingii (Chinese raspberry) were used as a kind of dietary traditional Chinese medicine. The methanolic extract of R. chingii fruits exhibited significant PTP1B inhibitory activity. Further bioactivity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of three PTP1B inhibitory ursane-type triterpenes: ursolic acid (1), 2-oxopomolic acid (2), and 2Î± 19Î±-dihydroxy-3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (3). Kinetics analyses revealed that 1 was a non-competitive PTP1B inhibitor, and 2 and 3 were mixed type PTP1B inhibitors. Compounds 1â€“3 and structurally related triterpenes (4â€“8) were further analyzed the structure-activity relationship, and were evaluated the inhibitory selectivity against four homologous protein tyrosine phosphatases (TCPTP, VHR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Molecular docking simulations were also carried out, and the result indicated that 1, 3-acetoxy-urs-12-ene-28-oic acid (5), and pomolic acid-3Î²-acetate (6) bound at the allosteric site including Î±3, Î±6, and Î±7 helix of PTP1B."
"The practical implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in medicine. The development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in medicine is advancing rapidly, but real-world clinical implementation has not yet become a reality. Here we review some of the key practical issues surrounding the implementation of AI into existing clinical workflows, including data sharing and privacy, transparency of algorithms, data standardization, and interoperability across multiple platforms, and concern for patient safety. We summarize the current regulatory environment in the United States and highlight comparisons with other regions in the world, notably Europe and China."
"Medical image classification using synergic deep learning. The classification of medical images is an essential task in computer-aided diagnosis, medical image retrieval and mining. Although deep learning has shown proven advantages over traditional methods that rely on the handcrafted features, it remains challenging due to the significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity caused by the diversity of imaging modalities and clinical pathologies. In this paper, we propose a synergic deep learning (SDL) model to address this issue by using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) simultaneously and enabling them to mutually learn from each other. Each pair of DCNNs has their learned image representation concatenated as the input of a synergic network, which has a fully connected structure that predicts whether the pair of input images belong to the same class. Thus, if one DCNN makes a correct classification, a mistake made by the other DCNN leads to a synergic error that serves as an extra force to update the model. This model can be trained end-to-end under the supervision of classification errors from DCNNs and synergic errors from each pair of DCNNs. Our experimental results on the ImageCLEF-2015, ImageCLEF-2016, ISIC-2016, and ISIC-2017 datasets indicate that the proposed SDL model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in these medical image classification tasks."
"Targeted protein degradation: expanding the toolbox. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and related molecules that induce targeted protein degradation by the ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system represent a new therapeutic modality and are the focus of great interest, owing to potential advantages over traditional occupancy-based inhibitors with respect to dosing, side effects, drug resistance and modulating â€˜undruggableâ€™ targets. However, the technology is still maturing, and the design elements for successful PROTAC-based drugs are currently being elucidated. Importantly, fewer than 10 of the more than 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases have so far been exploited for targeted protein degradation, and expansion of knowledge in this area is a key opportunity. Here, we briefly discuss lessons learned about targeted protein degradation in chemical biology and drug discovery and systematically review the expression profile, domain architecture and chemical tractability of human E3 ligases that could expand the toolbox for PROTAC discovery."
"Metabolic pathways associated with right ventricular adaptation to pulmonary hypertension: 3D analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. AIMS: We sought to identify metabolic pathways associated with right ventricular (RV) adaptation to pulmonary hypertension (PH). We evaluated candidate metabolites, previously associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension, and used automated image segmentation and parametric mapping to model their relationship to adverse patterns of remodelling and wall stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 312 PH subjects (47.1% female, mean age 60.8â€‰Â±â€‰15.9â€‰years), of which 182 (50.5% female, mean age 58.6â€‰Â±â€‰16.8â€‰years) had metabolomics, we modelled the relationship between the RV phenotype, haemodynamic state, and metabolite levels. Atlas-based segmentation and co-registration of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to create a quantitative 3D model of RV geometry and function-including maps of regional wall stress. Increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure was associated with hypertrophy of the basal free wall (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.29) and reduced relative wall thickness (Î² = -0.38), indicative of eccentric remodelling. Wall stress was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.27, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Six metabolites were significantly associated with elevated wall stress (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.28-0.34) including increased levels of tRNA-specific modified nucleosides and fatty acid acylcarnitines, and decreased levels (Î² = -0.40) of sulfated androgen. CONCLUSION: Using computational image phenotyping, we identify metabolic profiles, reporting on energy metabolism and cellular stress-response, which are associated with adaptive RV mechanisms to PH."
"An artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of patients with atrial fibrillation during sinus rhythm: a retrospective analysis of outcome prediction. BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. METHODS: We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95% CIs. FINDINGS: We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset, 64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8.4%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.88), sensitivity of 79.0% (77.5-80.4), specificity of 79.5% (79.0-79.9), F1 score of 39.2% (38.1-40.3), and overall accuracy of 79.4% (79.0-79.9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0.90 (0.90-0.91), sensitivity to 82.3% (80.9-83.6), specificity to 83.4% (83.0-83.8), F1 score to 45.4% (44.2-46.5), and overall accuracy to 83.3% (83.0-83.7). INTERPRETATION: An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. FUNDING: None."
"Agreement and Predictors of Discordance of 6 Visual Field Progression Algorithms. PURPOSE: To determine the agreement of 6 established visual field (VF) progression algorithms in a large dataset of VFs from multiple institutions and to determine predictors of discordance among these algorithms. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Visual fields from 5 major eye care institutions in the United States were analyzed, including a subset of eyes with at least 5 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm standard 24-2 VFs that met our reliability criteria. Of a total of 831 240 VFs, a subset of 90 713 VFs from 13 156 eyes of 8499 patients met the inclusion criteria. METHODS: Six commonly used VF progression algorithms (mean deviation [MD] slope, VF index slope, Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study, Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study, pointwise linear regression, and permutation of pointwise linear regression) were applied to this cohort, and each eye was determined to be stable or progressing using each measure. Agreement between individual algorithms was tested using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine predictors of discordance (3 algorithms progressing and 3 algorithms stable). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement and discordance between algorithms. RESULTS: Individual algorithms showed poor to moderate agreement with each other when compared directly (kappa range, 0.12-0.52). Based on at least 4 algorithms, 11.7% of eyes progressed. Major predictors of discordance or lack of agreement among algorithms were more depressed initial MD (P < 0.01) and older age at first available VF (P < 0.01). A greater number of VFs (P < 0.01), more years of follow-up (P < 0.01), and eye care institution (P = 0.03) also were associated with discordance. CONCLUSIONS: This extremely large comparative series demonstrated that existing algorithms have limited agreement and that agreement varies with clinical parameters, including institution. These issues underscore the challenges to the clinical use and application of progression algorithms and of applying big-data results to individual practices."
"A collaborative computer aided diagnosis (C-CAD) system with eye-tracking, sparse attentional model, and deep learning. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tools help radiologists to reduce diagnostic errors such as missing tumors and misdiagnosis. Vision researchers have been analyzing behaviors of radiologists during screening to understand how and why they miss tumors or misdiagnose. In this regard, eye-trackers have been instrumental in understanding visual search processes of radiologists. However, most relevant studies in this aspect are not compatible with realistic radiology reading rooms. In this study, we aim to develop a paradigm shifting CAD system, called collaborative CAD (C-CAD), that unifies CAD and eye-tracking systems in realistic radiology room settings. We first developed an eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. Second, we propose a novel algorithm that unifies eye-tracking data and a CAD system. Specifically, we present a new graph based clustering and sparsification algorithm to transform eye-tracking data (gaze) into a graph model to interpret gaze patterns quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed C-CAD collaborates with radiologists via eye-tracking technology and helps them to improve their diagnostic decisions. The C-CAD uses radiologists' search efficiency by processing their gaze patterns. Furthermore, the C-CAD incorporates a deep learning algorithm in a newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose suspicious areas simultaneously. The proposed C-CAD system has been tested in a lung cancer screening experiment with multiple radiologists, reading low dose chest CTs. Promising results support the efficiency, accuracy and applicability of the proposed C-CAD system in a real radiology room setting. We have also shown that our framework is generalizable to more complex applications such as prostate cancer screening with multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI)."
"RCorp: a resource for chemical disease semantic extraction in Chinese. BACKGROUND: To robustly identify synergistic combinations of drugs, high-throughput screenings are desirable. It will be of great help to automatically identify the relations in the published papers with machine learning based tools. To support the chemical disease semantic relation extraction especially for chronic diseases, a chronic disease specific corpus for combination therapy discovery in Chinese (RCorp) is manually annotated. METHODS: In this study, we extracted abstracts from a Chinese medical literature server and followed the annotation framework of the BioCreative CDR corpus, with the guidelines modified to make the combination therapy related relations available. An annotation tool was incorporated to the standard annotation process. RESULTS: The resulting RCorp consists of 339 Chinese biomedical articles with 2367 annotated chemicals, 2113 diseases, 237 symptoms, 164 chemical-induce-disease relations, 163 chemical-induce-symptom relations, and 805 chemical-treat-disease relations. Each annotation includes both the mention text spans and normalized concept identifiers. The corpus gets an inter-annotator agreement score of 0.883 for chemical entities, 0.791 for disease entities which are measured by F score. And the F score for chemical-treat-disease relations gets 0.788 after unifying the entity mentions. CONCLUSIONS: We extracted and manually annotated a chronic disease specific corpus for combination therapy discovery in Chinese. The result analysis of the corpus proves its quality for the combination therapy related knowledge discovery task. Our annotated corpus would be a useful resource for the modelling of entity recognition and relation extraction tools. In the future, an evaluation based on the corpus will be held."
"Automated detection of nonmelanoma skin cancer using digital images: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Computer-aided diagnosis of skin lesions is a growing area of research, but its application to nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is relatively under-studied. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the research that has been conducted on automated detection of NMSC using digital images and to assess the quality of evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of these technologies. METHODS: Eight databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and the ACM Digital Library) were searched to identify diagnostic studies of NMSC using image-based machine learning models. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles. The level of evidence of each study was evaluated using a five tier rating system, and the applicability and risk of bias of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies were reviewed. Twenty-four models were designed to detect basal cell carcinoma, two were designed to detect squamous cell carcinoma, and thirteen were designed to detect both. All studies were conducted in silico. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the classifiers, defined as concordance with histopathologic diagnosis, was high, with reported accuracies ranging from 72 to 100% and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.832 to 1. Most studies had substantial methodological limitations, but several were robustly designed and presented a high level of evidence. CONCLUSION: Most studies of image-based NMSC classifiers report performance greater than or equal to the reported diagnostic accuracy of the average dermatologist, but relatively few studies have presented a high level of evidence. Clinical studies are needed to assess whether these technologies can feasibly be implemented as a real-time aid for clinical diagnosis of NMSC."
"The modulation of gamma oscillations by methamphetamine in rat hippocampal slices. Gamma frequency oscillations (Î³, 30â€“100 Hz) have been suggested to underlie various cognitive and motor functions. The psychotomimetic drug methamphetamine (MA) enhances brain Î³ oscillations associated with changes in psychomotor state. Little is known about the cellular mechanisms of MA modulation on Î³ oscillations. We explored the effects of multiple intracellular kinases on MA modulation of Î³ induced by kainate in area CA3 of rat ventral hippocampal slices. We found that dopamine receptor type 1 and 2 (DR1 and DR2) antagonists, the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt inhibitor and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists prevented the enhancing effect of MA on Î³ oscillations, whereas none of them affected baseline Î³ strength. Protein kinase A, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and extracellular signal-related kinases inhibitors had no effect on MA. We propose that the DR1/DR2-Akt-NMDAR pathway plays a critical role for the MA enhancement of Î³ oscillations. Our study provides an new insight into the mechanisms of acute MA on MA-induced psychosis."
"In vitro and in silico molecular interaction of multiphase nanoparticles containing inositol hexaphosphate and jacalin: Therapeutic potential against colon cancer cells (HCT-15). Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) is a natural constituent found in almost all cereals and legumes. It is known to cause numerous antiangiogenic manifestations. Notwithstanding its great potential, it is underutilized due to the chelation and rapid excretion from the body. Jacalin is another natural constituent obtained from seeds of jackfruit and can target disaccharides overexpressed in tumor cells. The current study was in-quested to develop and evaluate a surface-modified gold nanoparticulate system containing IP6 and jacalin which may maximize the apoptotic effect of IP6 against HCT-15 cell lines. IP6 loaded jacalin-pectin-gold nanoparticles (IJP-GNPs) were developed through reduction followed by incubation method. The developed formulation was tested for various in vitro and in silico studies to investigate its potential. HCT-15 cells when exposed to IJP-GNP resulted in significant apoptotic effects in dose as well as time-dependent manner, as measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, micronucleus, and reactive oxygen species assay. IJP-GNP displayed cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. To further explore the mechanism of chemoprevention, in silico studies were performed. The docking results revealed that the interactive behavior of IP6, P-GNP, and jacalin could target and inhibit the tumor formation activity, supported by in vitro studies. Taken together, all the findings suggested that IP6 loaded nanoparticles may increase the hope of future drug delivery strategy for targeting colon cancer."
"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT. Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Methods: Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Results: We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, Ï‡ 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, Ï‡ 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusions: The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power."
"A study of deep learning methods for de-identification of clinical notes in cross-institute settings. BACKGROUND: De-identification is a critical technology to facilitate the use of unstructured clinical text while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. The clinical natural language processing (NLP) community has invested great efforts in developing methods and corpora for de-identification of clinical notes. These annotated corpora are valuable resources for developing automated systems to de-identify clinical text at local hospitals. However, existing studies often utilized training and test data collected from the same institution. There are few studies to explore automated de-identification under cross-institute settings. The goal of this study is to examine deep learning-based de-identification methods at a cross-institute setting, identify the bottlenecks, and provide potential solutions. METHODS: We created a de-identification corpus using a total 500 clinical notes from the University of Florida (UF) Health, developed deep learning-based de-identification models using 2014 i2b2/UTHealth corpus, and evaluated the performance using UF corpus. We compared five different word embeddings trained from the general English text, clinical text, and biomedical literature, explored lexical and linguistic features, and compared two strategies to customize the deep learning models using UF notes and resources. RESULTS: Pre-trained word embeddings using a general English corpus achieved better performance than embeddings from de-identified clinical text and biomedical literature. The performance of deep learning models trained using only i2b2 corpus significantly dropped (strict and relax F1 scores dropped from 0.9547 and 0.9646 to 0.8568 and 0.8958) when applied to another corpus annotated at UF Health. Linguistic features could further improve the performance of de-identification in cross-institute settings. After customizing the models using UF notes and resource, the best model achieved the strict and relaxed F1 scores of 0.9288 and 0.9584, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to customize de-identification models using local clinical text and other resources when applied in cross-institute settings. Fine-tuning is a potential solution to re-use pre-trained parameters and reduce the training time to customize deep learning-based de-identification models trained using clinical corpus from a different institution."
"Pyridine derivatives as anticancer lead compounds with Fatty Acid Synthase as the target: An in silico-guided in vitro study. For the past few decades, structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) has become an inevitable technique in the drug development process for screening hit compounds against therapeutic targets. Here, we have successfully used the SBDD approach viz. virtual high-throughput screening to identify potential inhibitors against the Ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain of Fatty acid synthase (FASN). Overexpression of FASN, and subsequent enhancement of de novo lipogenesis is a key survival strategy of cancer cells. Hence, targeting lipid metabolism using FASN inhibitors has been considered as a promising method to induce metabolic stress, thereby posing a survival disadvantage to cancer cells. In the present study, we have successfully identified eight FASN inhibitors from Asinex Elite database by implementing in silico tools. Five of the hit compounds share a common ring structure, which enables characteristic binding interactions with FASN-KS. Among them, in vitro validation showed that SFA 22637550 possesses significant FASN inhibitory activity and antiproliferative effect in human cancer cells of various origins. The maximum sensitivity was exhibited towards HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (IC50 = 28 ÂµM). The mode of cell death was found to be apoptosis with a significant increase in SubG0 population without affecting any other phases of the cell cycle. The current study puts forward an excellent core structure for the development of potent FASN inhibitors for successfully targeting cancer cell metabolism, thereby causing selective cell death."
"Effect of Electroencephalography-Guided Anesthetic Administration on Postoperative Delirium Among Older Adults Undergoing Major Surgery: The ENGAGES Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform suppression, often suggesting excessive general anesthesia, has been associated with postoperative delirium. Objective: To assess whether EEG-guided anesthetic administration decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial of 1232 adults aged 60 years and older undergoing major surgery and receiving general anesthesia at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis. Recruitment was from January 2015 to May 2018, with follow-up until July 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by cardiac vs noncardiac surgery and positive vs negative recent fall history) to receive EEG-guided anesthetic administration (n = 614) or usual anesthetic care (n = 618). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incident delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration, EEG suppression, and hypotension. Adverse events included undesirable intraoperative movement, intraoperative awareness with recall, postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical complications, and death. Results: Of the 1232 randomized patients (median age, 69 years [range, 60 to 95]; 563 women [45.7%]), 1213 (98.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 157 of 604 patients (26.0%) in the guided group and 140 of 609 patients (23.0%) in the usual care group (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, -2.0% to 8.0%]; P = .22). Median end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration was significantly lower in the guided group than the usual care group (0.69 vs 0.80 minimum alveolar concentration; difference, -0.11 [95% CI, -0.13 to -0.10), and median cumulative time with EEG suppression was significantly less (7 vs 13 minutes; difference, -6.0 [95% CI, -9.9 to -2.1]). There was no significant difference between groups in the median cumulative time with mean arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg (7 vs 7 minutes; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.7]). Undesirable movement occurred in 137 patients (22.3%) in the guided and 95 (15.4%) in the usual care group. No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 48 patients (7.8%) in the guided and 55 patients (8.9%) in the usual care group. Serious adverse events were reported in 124 patients (20.2%) in the guided and 130 (21.0%) in the usual care group. Within 30 days of surgery, 4 patients (0.65%) in the guided group and 19 (3.07%) in the usual care group died. Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults undergoing major surgery, EEG-guided anesthetic administration, compared with usual care, did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. This finding does not support the use of EEG-guided anesthetic administration for this indication. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02241655."
"The DNA methylation profile of non-coding RNAs improves prognosis prediction for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Background: Compelling lines of evidence indicate that DNA methylation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) plays critical roles in various tumour progression. In addition, the differential methylation of ncRNAs can predict prognosis of patients. However, little is known about the clear relationship between DNA methylation profile of ncRNAs and the prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) patients. Methods: The data of DNA methylation, RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical features of PAC patients were collected from TCGA database. The DNA methylation profile was obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. LASSO regression was performed to construct two methylation-based classifiers. The risk score of methylation-based classifiers was calculated for each patient, and the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting overall survival (OS) was examined by ROC curve analysis. In addition, Cox regression models were utilized to assess whether clinical variables and the classifiers were independent prognostic factors for OS. The targets of miRNA and the genes co-expressed with lncRNA were identified with DIANA microT-CDS and the Multi-Experiment Matrix (MEM), respectively. Moreover, DAVID Bioinformatics Resources were applied to analyse the functional enrichment of these targets and co-expressed genes. Results: A total of 4004 CpG sites of miRNA and 11,259 CpG sites of lncRNA were screened. Among these CpG sites, 8 CpG sites of miRNA and 7 CpG sites of lncRNA were found with regression coefficients. By multiplying the sum of methylation degrees of the selected CpGs with these coefficients, two methylation-based classifiers were constructed. The classifiers have shown good performance in predicting the survival rate of PAC patients at varying follow-up times. Interestingly, both of these two classifiers were predominant and independent factors for OS. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that aberrantly methylated miRNAs and lncRNAs are related to calcium ion transmembrane transport and MAPK, Ras and calcium signalling pathways. Conclusion: In the present study, we identified two methylation-based classifiers of ncRNA associated with OS in PAC patients through a comprehensive analysis of miRNA and lncRNA profiles. We are the first group to demonstrate a relationship between the aberrant DNA methylation of ncRNAs and the prognosis of PAC, and this relationship would contribute to individualized PAC therapy."
"Screening for cardiac contractile dysfunction using an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram. Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) is present in 3-6% of the general population, is associated with reduced quality of life and longevity, and is treatable when found(1-4). An inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool for ALVD in the doctor's office is not available. We tested the hypothesis that application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a routine method of measuring the heart's electrical activity, could identify ALVD. Using paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram data, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (a measure of contractile function), from 44,959 patients at the Mayo Clinic, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify patients with ventricular dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction </=35%, using the ECG data alone. When tested on an independent set of 52,870 patients, the network model yielded values for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93, 86.3%, 85.7%, and 85.7%, respectively. In patients without ventricular dysfunction, those with a positive AI screen were at 4 times the risk (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 5.0) of developing future ventricular dysfunction compared with those with a negative screen. Application of AI to the ECG-a ubiquitous, low-cost test-permits the ECG to serve as a powerful screening tool in asymptomatic individuals to identify ALVD."
"Quantifying the effects of data augmentation and stain color normalization in convolutional neural networks for computational pathology. Stain variation is a phenomenon observed when distinct pathology laboratories stain tissue slides that exhibit similar but not identical color appearance. Due to this color shift between laboratories, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with images from one lab often underperform on unseen images from the other lab. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the generalization error, mainly grouped into two categories: stain color augmentation and stain color normalization. The former simulates a wide variety of realistic stain variations during training, producing stain-invariant CNNs. The latter aims to match training and test color distributions in order to reduce stain variation. For the first time, we compared some of these techniques and quantified their effect on CNN classification performance using a heterogeneous dataset of hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images from 4 organs and 9 pathology laboratories. Additionally, we propose a novel unsupervised method to perform stain color normalization using a neural network. Based on our experimental results, we provide practical guidelines on how to use stain color augmentation and stain color normalization in future computational pathology applications."
"Combining entity co-occurrence with specialized word embeddings to measure entity relation in Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Extracting useful information from biomedical literature plays an important role in the development of modern medicine. In natural language processing, there have been rigorous attempts to find meaningful relationships between entities automatically by co-occurrence-based methods. It has been increasingly important to understand whether relationships exist, and if so how strong, between any two entities extracted from a large number of texts. One of the defining methods is to measure semantic similarity and relatedness between two entities. METHODS: We propose a hybrid ranking method that combines a co-occurrence approach considering both direct and indirect entity pair relationship with specialized word embeddings for measuring the relatedness of two entities. RESULTS: We evaluate the proposed ranking method comparatively with other well-known methods such as co-occurrence, Word2Vec, COALS (Correlated Occurrence Analog to Lexical Semantics), and random indexing by calculating top-ranked entities related to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we analyze gene, pathway, and gene-phenotype relationships. Overall, the proposed method tends to find more hidden relationships than the other methods. CONCLUSION: Our proposed method is able to select more useful related entities that not only highly co-occur but also have more indirect relations for the target entity. In pathway analysis, our proposed method shows superior performance at identifying (functional) cross clustering and higher-level pathways. Our proposed method, resulting from phenotype analysis, has an advantage in identifying the common genotype relating to phenotypes from biological literature."
"Robust motion correction for cardiac T1 and ECV mapping using a T1 relaxation model approach. T1 and ECV mapping are quantitative methods for myocardial tissue characterization using cardiac MRI, and are highly relevant for the diagnosis of diffuse myocardial diseases. Since the maps are calculated pixel-by-pixel from a set of MRI images with different T1-weighting, it is critical to assure exact spatial correspondence between these images. However, in practice, different sources of motion e.g. cardiac motion, respiratory motion or patient motion, hamper accurate T1 and ECV calculation such that retrospective motion correction is required. We propose a new robust non-rigid registration framework combining a data-driven initialization with a model-based registration approach, which uses a model for T1 relaxation to avoid direct registration of images with highly varying contrast. The registration between native T1 and enhanced T1 to obtain a motion free ECV map is also calculated using information from T1 model-fitting. The method was validated on three datasets recorded with two substantially different acquisition protocols (MOLLI (dataset 1 (n=15) and dataset 2 (n=29)) and STONE (dataset 3 (n = 210))), one in breath-hold condition and one free-breathing. The average Dice coefficient increased from 72.6+/-12.1% to 82.3+/-7.4% (P<0.05) and mean boundary error decreased from 2.91+/-1.51mm to 1.62+/-0.80mm (P<0.05) for motion correction in a single T1-weighted image sequence (3 datasets) while average Dice coefficient increased from 63.4+/-22.5% to 79.2+/-8.5% (P<0.05) and mean boundary error decreased from 3.26+/-2.64mm to 1.77+/-0.86mm (P<0.05) between native and enhanced sequences (dataset 1 and 2). Overall, the native T1 SD error decreased from 67.32+/-32.57ms to 58.11+/-21.59ms (P<0.05), enhanced SD error from 30.15+/-25ms to 22.74+/-8.94ms (P<0.05) and ECV SD error from 10.08+/-9.59% to 5.42+/-3.21% (P<0.05) (dataset 1 and 2)."
"Enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK by lutein and oxidised lutein that lead to mitochondrial biogenesis in hyperglycemic HepG2 cells. The stimulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a prime target to decrease the hyperglycemic condition, hence it is a lutein (L) and oxidised lutein (OXL) is a target molecule for the treatment of type II diabetes. In the current study, a plausible interaction of L and OXL with AMPK was investigated by molecular docking. In addition, the effect of L and OXL for the activation of AMPK that triggers the downstream regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator 1Î± (PGC-1Î±), TFAM expression, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), mitochondrial biogenesis and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in high glucose treated HepG2 cells were investigated by quantitativeÂ polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Molecular docking reveals higher binding affinity of L (Î”G = âˆ’6.3 kcal/mol) and OXL (Î”G = âˆ’15.5 kcal/mol) with AMPK, compared with metformin (Î”G = âˆ’5.0 kcal/mol). The phosphorylation of AMPK increased by 1.3- and 1.5-fold with L and OXL treatment, respectively, in high glucose induced HepG2 cells. The activation of PGC-1Î± is significant (P < 0.05) in OXL group than L. Similarly, TFAM expression is increased with L and OXL compared with the high glucose group. Further increase in SOD2 and mtDNA, confirms the efficacy of L and OXL in restoring the mitochondrial biogenesis in high glucose induced cells through AMPK, PGC-1Î±, and TFAM."
"Chest Radiographs in Congestive Heart Failure: Visualizing Neural Network Learning. Purpose To examine Generative Visual Rationales (GVRs) as a tool for visualizing neural network learning of chest radiograph features in congestive heart failure (CHF). Materials and Methods A total of 103 489 frontal chest radiographs in 46 712 patients acquired from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, were divided into a labeled data set (with B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] result as a marker of CHF) and unlabeled data set (without BNP result). A generative model was trained on the unlabeled data set, and a neural network was trained on the encoded representations of the labeled data set to estimate BNP. The model was used to visualize how a radiograph with high estimated BNP would look without disease (a ""healthy"" radiograph). An overfitted model was developed for comparison, and 100 GVRs were blindly assessed by two experts for features of CHF. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), kappa coefficient, and mixed-effects logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. Results At a cutoff BNP of 100 ng/L as a marker of CHF, the correctly trained model achieved an AUC of 0.82. Assessment of GVRs revealed that the correctly trained model highlighted conventional radiographic features of CHF as reasons for an elevated BNP prediction more frequently than the overfitted model, including cardiomegaly (153 [76.5%] of 200 vs 64 [32%] of 200, respectively; P < .001) and pleural effusions (47 [23.5%] of 200 vs 16 [8%] of 200, respectively; P = .003). Conclusion Features of congestive heart failure on chest radiographs learned by neural networks can be identified using Generative Visual Rationales, enabling detection of bias and overfitted models.

"TFAP2C- and p63-Dependent Networks Sequentially Rearrange Chromatin Landscapes to Drive Human Epidermal Lineage Commitment. Tissue development results from lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) programming a dynamic chromatin landscape through progressive cell fate transitions. Here, we define epigenomic landscape during epidermal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and create inference networks that integrate gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and TF binding to define regulatory mechanisms during keratinocyte specification. We found two critical chromatin networks during surface ectoderm initiation and keratinocyte maturation, which are driven by TFAP2C and p63, respectively. Consistently, TFAP2C, but not p63, is sufficient to initiate surface ectoderm differentiation, and TFAP2C-initiated progenitor cells are capable of maturing into functional keratinocytes. Mechanistically, TFAP2C primes the surface ectoderm chromatin landscape and induces p63 expression and binding sites, thus allowing maturation factor p63 to positively autoregulate its own expression and close a subset of the TFAP2C-initiated surface ectoderm program. Our work provides a general framework to infer TF networks controlling chromatin transitions that will facilitate future regenerative medicine advances."
"An automatic restoration framework based on GPU-accelerated collateral filtering in brain MR images. BACKGROUND: Image restoration is one of the fundamental and essential tasks within image processing. In medical imaging, developing an effective algorithm that can automatically remove random noise in brain magnetic resonance (MR) images is challenging. The collateral filter has been shown a more powerful algorithm than many existing methods. However, the computation of the collateral filter is more time-consuming and the selection of the filter parameters is also laborious. This paper proposes an automatic noise removal system based on the accelerated collateral filter for brain MR images. METHODS: To solve these problems, we first accelerated the collateral filter with parallel computing using the graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture. We adopted the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), an application programming interface for the GPU by NVIDIA, to hasten the computation. Subsequently, the optimal filter parameters were selected and the automation was achieved by artificial neural networks. Specifically, an artificial neural network system associated with image feature analysis was adopted to establish the automatic image restoration framework. The best feature combination was selected by the paired t-test and the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) methods. RESULTS: Experimental results indicated that not only did the proposed automatic image restoration algorithm perform dramatically faster than the traditional collateral filter, but it also effectively removed the noise in a wide variety of brain MR images. A speed up gain of 34 was attained to process an MR image, which completed within 0.1â€‰s. Representative illustrations of brain tumor images demonstrated the capability of identifying lesion boundaries, which outperformed many existing methods. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that our accelerated and automated restoration framework is promising for achieving robust filtering in many brain MR image restoration applications."
"Computer Vision Analysis of Intraoperative Video: Automated Recognition of Operative Steps in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop and assess AI algorithms to identify operative steps in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). BACKGROUND: Computer vision, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), allows for quantitative analysis of video by computers for identification of objects and patterns, such as in autonomous driving. METHODS: Intraoperative video from LSG from an academic institution was annotated by 2 fellowship-trained, board-certified bariatric surgeons. Videos were segmented into the following steps: 1) port placement, 2) liver retraction, 3) liver biopsy, 4) gastrocolic ligament dissection, 5) stapling of the stomach, 6) bagging specimen, and 7) final inspection of staple line. Deep neural networks were used to analyze videos. Accuracy of operative step identification by the AI was determined by comparing to surgeon annotations. RESULTS: Eighty-eight cases of LSG were analyzed. A random 70% sample of these clips was used to train the AI and 30% to test the AI's performance. Mean concordance correlation coefficient for human annotators was 0.862, suggesting excellent agreement. Mean (+/-SD) accuracy of the AI in identifying operative steps in the test set was 82% +/- 4% with a maximum of 85.6%. CONCLUSIONS: AI can extract quantitative surgical data from video with 85.6% accuracy. This suggests operative video could be used as a quantitative data source for research in intraoperative clinical decision support, risk prediction, or outcomes studies."
"Proteasome-associated cysteine deubiquitinases are molecular targets of environmental optical brightener compounds. The levels of organic pollutants, such as optical brightener (OB) compounds, in the global environment have been increasing in recent years. The toxicological effects and signal transduction systems associated with OB toxicity have not been thoroughly studied. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in regulating multiple essential cellular processes, and proteasome-associated cysteine deubiquitinases (DUBs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L5 (UCHL5) and USP14, are two major regulators for (de)ubiquitination and stability of many important target proteins. Therefore, potential inhibition of UCHL5 and USP14 activities by some environmental chemicals might cause in vivo toxicity. In the current study we hypothesize that electrophilic OB compounds, such as 4,4â€²-diamino-2,2â€²-stilbenedisulfonic acid(DAST), fluorescent brightener 28 (FB-28) and FB-71, can interact with the catalytic triads (CYS, HIS, and ASP) of UCHL5 and USP14 and inhibit their enzymatic activities, leading to cell growth suppression. This hypothesis is supported by our findings presented in this study. Results from in silico computational docking and ubiquitin vinyl sulfone assay confirmed the UCHL5/USP14-inhibitory activities of these OB compounds that have potencies in an order of: FB-71 > FB-28 > DAST. Furthermore, inhibition of these two proteasomal DUBs by OBs resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in two human breast cancer cell models. In addition, we found that OB-mediated DUB inhibition triggers a feedback reaction in which expression of UCHL5 and USP14 proteins is increased to compromise the suppressed activities. Our study suggests that these commonly used OB compounds may target and inhibit proteasomal cysteine DUBs, which should contribute to their toxicological effects in vivo."
"Next-generation sequencing with comprehensive bioinformatics analysis facilitates somatic mosaic APC gene mutation detection in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Background: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant colorectal tumor characterized by numerous adenomatous colonic polyps that often lead to colon cancer. Although most patients with FAP harbored germline mutations in APC gene, it was recently recognized that patients with clinical FAP, but without detectable pathogenic mutations, could be associated with somatic mosaic APC mutation. Methods: We reanalyzed the nest-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel testing results of patients who were diagnosed with FAP, but did not have APC mutations, at Yonsei Cancer Prevention Center between July 2016 and March 2018. We tested several variant calling algorithms to identify low level mosaic variants. In one patient with a low frequency APC mutation, NGS analysis was performed together with endoscopic biopsy. Variant calling tools HaplotypeCaller, MuTect2, VarScan2, and Pindel were used. We also used 3â€²-Modified Oligonucleotides (MEMO)-PCR or conventional PCR for confirmation. Results: Among 28 patients with clinical suspicion of FAP but no detectable pathogenic variants of colonic polyposis associated genes, somatic mosaic pathogenic variants were identified in seven patients. The variant allele frequency ranged from 0.3 to 7.7%. These variants were mostly detected through variant caller MuTect2 and Pindel, and were further confirmed using mutant enrichment with MEMO-PCR. Conclusions: The NGS with an adequate combination of bioinformatics tools is effective to detect low level somatic variants in a single assay. Because mosaic APC mutations are more frequent than previously thought, the presence of mosaic mutations must be considered when analyzing genetic tests of patients with FAP."
"Convolutional neural networks for automated fracture detection and localization on wrist radiographs. Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of an object detection convolutional neural network (CNN) for fracture detection and localization on wrist radiographs. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained with waiver of consent for this retrospective study. A total of 7356 wrist radiographic studies were extracted from a hospital picture archiving and communication system. Radiologists annotated all radius and ulna fractures with bounding boxes. The dataset was split into training (90%) and validation (10%) sets and used to train fracture localization models for frontal and lateral images. Inception-ResNet Faster R-CNN architecture was implemented as a deep learning model. The models were tested on an unseen test set of 524 consecutive emergency department wrist radiographic studies with two radiologists in consensus as the reference standard. Per-fracture, per-image (ie, per-view), and per-study sensitivity and specificity were determined. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was performed. Results: The model detected and correctly localized 310 (91.2%) of 340 and 236 (96.3%) of 245 of all radius and ulna fractures on the frontal and lateral views, respectively. The per-image sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 95.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.4%, 97.8%), 82.5% (95% CI: 77.4%, 86.8%), and 0.918 (95% CI: 0.894, 0.941), respectively, for the frontal view and 96.7% (95% CI: 93.6%, 98.6%), 86.4% (95% CI: 81.9%, 90.2%), and 0.933 (95% CI: 0.912, 0.954), respectively, for the lateral view. The per-study sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 98.1% (95% CI: 95.6%, 99.4%), 72.9% (95% CI: 67.1%, 78.2%), and 0.895 (95% CI: 0.870, 0.920), respectively. Conclusion: The ability of an object detection CNN to detect and localize radius and ulna fractures on wrist radiographs with high sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated."
"Studies of the Anti-amnesic Effects and Mechanisms of Single and Combined Use of Donepezil and Ginkgo Ketoester Tablet on Scopolamine-Induced Memory Impairment in Mice. Ginkgo ketoester tablets (GT) and donepezil were a clinically used combination for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was undertaken to investigate the antiamnesic effects of the two drugs alone and in combination through in vivo models of the Morris water maze along with in vitro antioxidants, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The potential mechanisms were speculated by the activities of acetylcholine (ACh), AChE, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine protein kinase B (TrkB). The combination group showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of cholinesterase and antioxidation. As far as its mechanism was concerned, the combination of two drugs exerted excellent effects on oxidative stress, cholinergic pathway damage, and inactivation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. Additionally, to elucidate the binding mechanism of GT active ingredients into the structure of AChE, the results of molecular docking studies indicated that hydrogen and/or hydrophobic bonds might play an important role in their binding process. Thus, the combination of drugs could treat AD perfectly and further verify the scientific rationality of clinical medication."
"Identification of Factors Associated With Variation in US County-Level Obesity Prevalence Rates Using Epidemiologic vs Machine Learning Models. Importance: Obesity is a leading cause of high health care expenditures, disability, and premature mortality. Previous studies have documented geographic disparities in obesity prevalence. Objective: To identify county-level factors associated with obesity using traditional epidemiologic and machine learning methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using linear regression models and machine learning models to evaluate the associations between county-level obesity and county-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors from summarized statistical data extracted from the 2018 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and merged with US Census data from each of 3138 US counties. The explanatory power of the linear multivariate regression and the top performing machine learning model were compared using mean R2 measured in 30-fold cross validation. Exposures: County-level demographic factors (population; rural status; census region; and race/ethnicity, sex, and age composition), socioeconomic factors (median income, unemployment rate, and percentage of population with some college education), health care factors (rate of uninsured adults and primary care physicians), and environmental factors (access to healthy foods and access to exercise opportunities). Main Outcomes and Measures: County-level obesity prevalence in 2018, its association with each county-level factor, and the percentage of variation in county-level obesity prevalence explained by linear multivariate and gradient boosting machine regression measured with R2. Results: Among the 3138 counties studied, the mean (range) obesity prevalence was 31.5% (12.8%-47.8%). In multivariate regressions, demographic factors explained 44.9% of variation in obesity prevalence; socioeconomic factors, 33.0%; environmental factors, 15.5%; and health care factors, 9.1%. The county-level factors with the strongest association with obesity were census region, median household income, and percentage of population with some college education. R2 values of univariate regressions of obesity prevalence were 0.238 for census region, 0.218 for median household income, and 0.160 for percentage of population with some college education. Multivariate linear regression and gradient boosting machine regression (the best-performing machine learning model) of obesity prevalence using all county-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors had R2 values of 0.58 and 0.66, respectively (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Obesity prevalence varies significantly between counties. County-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors explain the majority of variation in county-level obesity prevalence. Using machine learning models may explain significantly more of the variation in obesity prevalence.."
"Guideline-Based Clinical Assessment Versus Procalcitonin-Guided Antibiotic Use in Pneumonia: A Pragmatic Randomized Trial. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Efforts to reduce unnecessary and unnecessarily long antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia have been attempted through use of procalcitonin and through guidelines based on serial clinical assessment. Our aim is to compare guideline-based clinical assessment- and procalcitonin algorithm-guided antibiotic use among patients with community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a pragmatic, randomized, multicenter trial from November 2012 to April 2015 at 12 French hospitals. We included emergency department (ED) patients older than 18 years with community-acquired pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned to either the procalcitonin-guided or clinical assessment group. In accordance with past studies, we hypothesized that serial clinical assessment would be superior to procalcitonin-guided care. The primary outcome was antibiotic duration, and secondary outcomes included rates of antibiotic duration less than or equal to 5 days, and clinical success and combined serious adverse outcomes at 30 days in the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: Of 370 eligible patients, 285 (77%) were randomly assigned to either clinical assessment- (n=143) or procalcitonin-guided care (n=142). Median age was 67 years (range 18 to 93 years) and 40% of patients were deemed to have Pneumonia Severity Index class IV or V. Procalcitonin algorithm adherence was 76%. Antibiotic duration was not significantly different between clinical assessment- and procalcitonin-guided groups (median 9 versus 10 days, respectively). Clinical success rate was 92% in each group and serious adverse outcome rates were similar (15% versus 20%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Guideline-based serial clinical assessment did not reduce antibiotic exposure compared with procalcitonin-guided care among ED patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The strategies were similar in terms of duration of antibiotic use and clinical outcomes."
"Towards early detection of adverse drug reactions: combining pre-clinical drug structures and post-market safety reports. BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a major burden for patients and healthcare industry. Early and accurate detection of potential ADRs can help to improve drug safety and reduce financial costs. Post-market spontaneous reports of ADRs remain a cornerstone of pharmacovigilance and a series of drug safety signal detection methods play an important role in providing drug safety insights. However, existing methods require sufficient case reports to generate signals, limiting their usages for newly approved drugs with few (or even no) reports. METHODS: In this study, we propose a label propagation framework to enhance drug safety signals by combining drug chemical structures with FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). First, we compute original drug safety signals via common signal detection algorithms. Then, we construct a drug similarity network based on chemical structures. Finally, we generate enhanced drug safety signals by propagating original signals on the drug similarity network. Our proposed framework enriches post-market safety reports with pre-clinical drug similarity network, effectively alleviating issues of insufficient cases for newly approved drugs. RESULTS: We apply the label propagation framework to four popular signal detection algorithms (PRR, ROR, MGPS, BCPNN) and find that our proposed framework generates more accurate drug safety signals than the corresponding baselines. In addition, our framework identifies potential ADRs for newly approved drugs, thus paving the way for early detection of ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed label propagation framework combines pre-clinical drug structures with post-market safety reports, generates enhanced drug safety signals, and can potentially help to accurately detect ADRs ahead of time.

"End-to-End Differentiable Learning of Protein Structure. Predicting protein structure from sequence is a central challenge of biochemistry. Co-evolution methods show promise, but an explicit sequence-to-structure map remains elusive. Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed pipelines with differentiable models optimized end to end suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating structure prediction. Here, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for protein structure learning. The model couples local and global protein structure via geometric units that optimize global geometry without violating local covalent chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks: predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and predicting known folds without structural templates. In the first task, the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and in the second, it comes within 1â€“2 Ã…; competing methods using co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over many years, and it is likely that the differentiable approach has substantial room for further improvement, with applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design."
"Automated detection and classification of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images using clinical-knowledge-guided convolutional neural networks. Accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules using ultrasonography is a valuable but tough task even for experienced radiologists, considering both benign and malignant nodules have heterogeneous appearances. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods could potentially provide objective suggestions to assist radiologists. However, the performance of existing learning-based approaches is still limited, for direct application of general learning models often ignores critical domain knowledge related to the specific nodule diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel deep-learning-based CAD system, guided by task-specific prior knowledge, for automated nodule detection and classification in ultrasound images. Our proposed CAD system consists of two stages. First, a multi-scale region-based detection network is designed to learn pyramidal features for detecting nodules at different feature scales. The region proposals are constrained by the prior knowledge about size and shape distributions of real nodules. Then, a multi-branch classification network is proposed to integrate multi-view diagnosis-oriented features, in which each network branch captures and enhances one specific group of characteristics that were generally used by radiologists. We evaluated and compared our method with the state-of-the-art CAD methods and experienced radiologists on two datasets, i.e. Dataset I and Dataset II. The detection and diagnostic accuracy on Dataset I were 97.5% and 97.1%, respectively. Besides, our CAD system also achieved better performance than experienced radiologists on Dataset II, with improvements of accuracy for 8%. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is effective in the discrimination of thyroid nodules."
"Genome-wide de novo L1 Retrotransposition Connects Endonuclease Activity with Replication. L1 retrotransposon-derived sequences comprise approximately 17% of the human genome. Darwinian selective pressures alter L1 genomic distributions during evolution, confounding the ability to determine initial L1 integration preferences. Here, we generated high-confidence datasets of greater than 88,000 engineered L1 insertions in human cell lines that act as proxies for cells that accommodate retrotransposition in vivo. Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1 endonuclease activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences, demonstrated that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed regions, or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the L1 endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA replication templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus, acquisition of an endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate into replicating DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed retrotransposon. The examination of de novo engineered L1 retrotransposition events in cultured human cells reveals that L1 endonuclease activity and DNA replication dictate L1 insertion preferences and promote its widespread integration throughout the human genome."
"A comparison of machine learning techniques for classification of HIV patients with antiretroviral therapy-induced mitochondrial toxicity from those without mitochondrial toxicity. BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However, therapeutic benefit of ART is often limited by delayed drug-associated toxicity. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are the backbone of ART regimens. NRTIs compete with endogenous deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) in incorporation into elongating DNA chain resulting in their cytotoxic or antiviral effect. Thus, the efficacy of NRTIs could be affected by direct competition with endogenous dNTPs and/or feedback inhibition of their metabolic enzymes. In this paper, we assessed whether the levels of ribonucleotides (RN) and dNTP pool sizes can be used as biomarkers in distinguishing between HIV-infected patients with ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity and HIV-infected patients without toxicity. METHODS: We used data collected through a case-control study from 50 subjects. Cases were defined as HIV-infected individuals with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of mitochondrial toxicity. Each case was age, gender, and race matched with an HIV-positive without evidence of toxicity. We used a range of machine learning procedures to distinguish between patients with and without toxicity. Using resampling methods like Monte Carlo k-fold cross validation, we compared the accuracy of several machine learning algorithms applied to our data. We used the algorithm with highest classification accuracy rate in evaluating the diagnostic performance of 12 RN and 14 dNTP pool sizes as biomarkers of mitochondrial toxicity. RESULTS: We used eight classification algorithms to assess the diagnostic performance of RN and dNTP pool sizes distinguishing HIV patients with and without NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity. The algorithms resulted in cross-validated classification rates of 0.65-0.76 for dNTP and 0.72-0.83 for RN, following reduction of the dimensionality of the input data. The reduction of input variables improved the classification performance of the algorithms, with the most pronounced improvement for RN. Complex tree-based methods worked the best for both the deoxyribose dataset (Random Forest) and the ribose dataset (Classification Tree and AdaBoost), but it is worth noting that simple methods such as Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression were very competitive in terms of classification performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of changes in RN and dNTP pools in participants with mitochondrial toxicity validates the importance of dNTP pools in mitochondrial function. Hence, levels of RN and dNTP pools can be used as biomarkers of ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity."
